-> Last week I was out on the road traveling to and around Northeast Arkansas. It was great to visit so many communities and have opportunities to discuss what the latest news is, the pressing issues that need attention and ways my office can help. You can check out a recap of my trip here: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/dr-boozman-s-check-up?id=11BD5221-71DB-46E6-B4D1-9A00B95344DF

-> At a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing on Thursday, I discussed the I-40 bridge with USDOT leadership and the need to cooperate with all local and state entities to help safely reopen it. This is a real-world example of the need for targeted investment in our core infrastructure, including roads and bridges, which Senate Republicans have offered in our latest proposal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhANRmffHhM. 5NEWS reported on my efforts to help ensure the process to manage this situation and repair the bridge is collaborative, efficient and ultimately leads to a successful, speedy outcome: https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/national/arkansas-senator-john-boozman-urges-dot-to-safely-quickly-repair-i-40-bridge/527-9df7ef3a-bbcc-4772-a7d7-184c039fd171

-> Today, I also convened a call with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and members of the Arkansas and Tennessee Congressional Delegations to urge him to support the efforts to safely and efficiently repair the I-40 bridge. Sec. Buttigieg assured us the U.S. Department of Transportation is working with both the AR and TN transportation departments to ensure a pathway to efficiently repairing and reopening the bridge and that his staff would continue to communicate with and update us as the process advances: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=4E55AC30-498A-4645-B494-695135DD3B7B

-> This has been National Police Week, so I shared my support for our law enforcement officers in a speech on the Senate floor and thanked them for doing their important job with or without thanks. This week especially has been a time to show them our gratitude not just with words, but action. I'm sponsoring the Back the Blue Act and the Protect and Serve Act to support police and help them keep our communities safe. I also paid tribute to the AR's fallen officers who died in the line of duty this past year: James Dancy (North Little Rock), Travis Wallace (Helena-West Helena), Kevin Collins (Pine Bluff) and Brent Scrimshire (Hot Springs). We're forever grateful for each of them: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=AA01F477-9848-4510-B2BB-C733817E912C

-> We should always be looking for ways to better support military families. I’m proud to have helped lead a bipartisan effort aimed at doing that in two specific ways: meeting employment and childcare needs. My recently introduced Jobs and Childcare for Military Families Act seeks to do both. Learn more: https://www.nwahomepage.com/news/sen-boozman-introduces-bill-to-help-military-spouses-find-jobs-childcare/?utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral

-> COVID-19 has made it clear more must be done to improve and expand access to telehealth services. READ my latest column about why it's becoming more popular and my efforts to sustain and enhance this option for patients in Arkansas and nationwide: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/weekly-columns?ID=19F15487-9814-4EBC-B6E5-BD3DD1DD1835

-> Every life is precious. I'm proud to join so many colleagues in defense of Arkansas's actions to protect babies diagnosed with Down Syndrome. They're worth fighting for and deserving of love, care and empowerment. Their differences don't make them any less valuable or worthy. Senator Cotton and I, along with other senators and members of the House of Representatives, filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in the case of Little Rock Planning Services v. Rutledge urging the court to uphold Arkansas’s law to protect unborn babies with Down Syndrome. Read more from Fox News: https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cotton-hinson-amicus-downs-abortions

-> Several issues made national headlines this week: The Senate Rules Committee held a mark-up of S.1, the so-called “For the People Act,” which is really a federal takeover of our elections and something I’ve spoken out against alongside Arkansas Secretary of State John Thurston. The bill received a tie vote in committee and is stalled for the moment, but I will continue to oppose it because of its unconstitutional nature and terrible implications for our state. We also received news that the crisis at our southern border continues to persist. There were more than 350,000 migrant apprehensions at the border in March and April of this year – the highest consecutive monthly total in 15 years. My advice to the administration is take this situation seriously and act now to solve it instead of the disastrous approach it has pursued so far.

-> As you may know, there has been ongoing violence in Israel, including attacks on civilians by the terrorist organization Hamas. The U.S. stands with and supports our friend and strategic ally Israel and its indisputable right to defend itself and secure the safety of its people. I've also joined Senator Rubio and 42 other GOP senators urging Pres. Biden to uphold sanctions on Iran, Hamas' financier. My full statement: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=press-releases&id=BCE28535-1986-4180-A915-597D9FD352FF

-> The Biden administration also rolled out its “America the Beautiful” plan, also known as 30x30, and I shared my concerns about its impact on agriculture and land owners with E&E News: https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063731979

-> I joined Congressman Womack and Senator Cotton to announce that XNA Northwest Arkansas National Airport received a 4.6 million grant to rehabilitate a taxiway. The airport is vital connector and economic engine in the community and an integral part of our region’s infrastructure. This strategic investment will support the airport's growth and operations. Learn more from Talk Business & Politics-Statewide: https://talkbusiness.net/2021/05/xna-receives-4-6-million-to-complete-taxiway-rehabilitation-project/

-> We got welcome news from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency this week. Producers who raise fish for food should now be able to recover losses caused by February’s devastating winter storm. Previously only farm-raised game and bait fish were eligible, leaving many producers without ability to recover losses. I encourage aquaculture producers impacted by the storms to reach out to their local FSA office for more information and assistance: https://www.fsa.usda.gov/news-room/news-releases/2021/usda-expands-aquaculture-disaster-assistance-to-include-fish-raised-for-food?utm_campaign=disasterassistanceaquaculture&utm_medium=email&utm_source=thespiritinthesky

-> This week has also been National Hospital Week. It’s been a timely reminder to share our support and gratitude for those working in hospitals in our own communities and nationwide. They're committed to our health and wellbeing, and work incredibly hard to help take care of patients and promote healthy living. https://twitter.com/JohnBoozman/status/1392545802183139328

-> I enjoyed getting to talk with students virtually at Parkview Arts/Science Magnet High School- LRSD at the start of the week. These SIFMA Foundation 2021 Capitol Hill Challenge team members are bright and interesting young people, and I appreciated getting to talk with them about financial education: https://twitter.com/JohnBoozman/status/1391847189320802307

-> May is Foster Care Awareness Month. I'm proud to cosponsor the Timely Mental Health for Foster Youth Act to ensure children who enter foster care get needed mental health screening and treatment. Providing them access to safe and supportive care is vital: https://t.co/1fOzyGyRO8?amp=1

-> Senator Cotton and I also introduced the Estate Tax Reduction Act this week, legislation to reduce the estate tax to 20 percent—half of the current top rate of 40 percent. Arkansas’s family farmers and small business owners shouldn’t be punished for passing what they’ve established, grown and maintained onto the next generation. Our bill reduces this burden and gives these entrepreneurs and job creators more assurance that their years of hard work and investment can be carried on by their children and grandchildren instead of being forfeited to the federal government: https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-boozman-introduce-bill-to-reduce-estate-tax

-> I stopped by Har-Ber High School in Springdale today visit with City of Springdale, AR - Mayor's Office Mayor Doug Sprouse and Springdale School District Superintendent Jared Cleveland to get an update on what’s happening at the school and in the district, including navigating in-person learning during the pandemic and the school meals program. I also enjoyed getting to see Jax Nalley, one of Arkansas’s 2021 United States Senate Youth Program participants, to continue our earlier virtual conversation about his academics and extracurricular activities, and wish him luck on graduation and starting college in the fall: https://twitter.com/JohnBoozman/status/1393270506279874561
