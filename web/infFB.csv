Here are some of the worst policies in this hyperpartisan bill

Guts Overwhelmingly Popular State Voter ID Laws: S.1 would render state voter ID laws meaningless by requiring states to allow affidavits in lieu of identification.

Allows Unlimited Ballot Harvesting: S.1 allows paid campaign operatives to collect ballots. Ballot harvesting is prohibited or limited in some states because it creates the risk of fraud, where harvesters either fake ballots or deceive voters, especially the elderly

Mandates Ballot Drop Boxes: Combined w/ unlimited ballot harvesting, drop boxes boost risk of fraud by allowing people other than the voter to drop off marked ballots outside of the view of election officials/poll workers & increase the risk of ballots being stolen or destroyed.

Restricts States‚Äô Ability to Maintain Accurate Voter Rolls: S.1 would restrict states‚Äô ability to remove inaccurate and duplicate registrations from voter rolls.

Provides Government Funding for Campaigns: $6 of fed gov't money would be sent to political candidates for every $1 they raise from small donors. This provision could essentially force Americans to fund candidates they don‚Äôt agree with & support attack ads against those they do.

Creates a Partisan FEC: S.1 gets rid of the bipartisan makeup of the Federal Election Commission ‚Äì giving the party in power an advantage in seats and the ability to control the commission‚Äôs agenda.

Chills Free Speech: S.1 chills speech through cumbersome and misleading donor disclosures and allows the IRS to look at a group‚Äôs ideology when considering whether or not to grant it tax exempt status.

Federalizes Redistricting: S.1 would put in place 1 set of federal rules for redrawing congressional districts, which has traditionally been a role for each state. If someone doesn‚Äôt like the commission's work, S.1 provides multiple opportunities for fed courts to draw the maps

Imposes Costly, Burdensome Mandates on States: S.1 requires election officials to take on burdensome/costly changes to their election systems. Even if states have adopted some ‚Äúreforms‚Äù in S.1, they'd have to make changes to their systems to comply with S.1 before next election","In 800+ pages, Democrats managed to pack a slew of bad policies that would send our election system into chaos and undermine Americans' faith in the system.

Here are some of the worst policies in this hyperpartisan bill

Guts Overwhelmingly Popular State Voter ID Laws: S.1 would render state voter ID laws meaningless by requiring states to allow affidavits in lieu of identification.

Allows Unlimited Ballot Harvesting: S.1 allows paid campaign operatives to collect ballots. Ballot harvesting is prohibited or limited in some states because it creates the risk of fraud, where harvesters either fake ballots or deceive voters, especially the elderly

Mandates Ballot Drop Boxes: Combined w/ unlimited ballot harvesting, drop boxes boost risk of fraud by allowing people other than the voter to drop off marked ballots outside of the view of election officials/poll workers & increase the risk of ballots being stolen or destroyed.

Restricts States‚Äô Ability to Maintain Accurate Voter Rolls: S.1 would restrict states‚Äô ability to remove inaccurate and duplicate registrations from voter rolls.

Provides Government Funding for Campaigns: $6 of fed gov't money would be sent to political candidates for every $1 they raise from small donors. This provision could essentially force Americans to fund candidates they don‚Äôt agree with & support attack ads against those they do.

Creates a Partisan FEC: S.1 gets rid of the bipartisan makeup of the Federal Election Commission ‚Äì giving the party in power an advantage in seats and the ability to control the commission‚Äôs agenda.

Chills Free Speech: S.1 chills speech through cumbersome and misleading donor disclosures and allows the IRS to look at a group‚Äôs ideology when considering whether or not to grant it tax exempt status.

Federalizes Redistricting: S.1 would put in place 1 set of federal rules for redrawing congressional districts, which has traditionally been a role for each state. If someone doesn‚Äôt like the commission's work, S.1 provides multiple opportunities for fed courts to draw the maps
