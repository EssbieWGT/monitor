Following the attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States' involvement in #WWII, the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) was officially established as part of our nation's immense war mobilization efforts. These exceptional women graduated from Fort Des Moines in August 1942.

Though they weren't officially part of the Army, they fulfilled all the duties of soldiers, but did not get the same pay, rank, protections, or benefits. In 1943, however, President Roosevelt established the Women's Army Corps, which finally granted women full military status.
