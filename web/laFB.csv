Every day, law enforcement professionals lace up their boots and don the badge knowing this day could be their last. They know that just one call gone wrong or one split-second decision during a traffic stop could mean the difference between returning home to see their family or never coming home again.

Still, they show up every day. They don’t do it for the money or the fame. They live to protect and serve, to keep our communities and families safe. They put in countless hours, long shifts, endure endless abuse from the folks they’re trying to help, and they do it all with love, dedication, and passion for the work they do.

It’s a thankless job. More often than not, police officers are meeting people on their absolute worst day. Whether they’re handing out a speeding ticket to a reckless driver putting others at risk or trying to talk down a drug addict hanging on by a thread, they approach every situation looking to help, even when the odds seemed stacked against them. America’s police officers routinely go above and beyond to live up to their mission—to protect and serve.

That’s why I’m proud to stand up and honor all our police officers during National Police Week. At a time when America’s law enforcement officers are facing unprecedented attacks in the media and from liberal politicians, they need our support. The notion of “defunding the police,” as some have called for, is absurd and repugnant. We should reject it at every turn.

It doesn’t even make sense. We don’t “defund” roadways because there’s potholes. We don’t “defund” schools because our children aren’t learning enough. Instead of defunding the police, local communities should be investing in law enforcement. They should be investing in better training, investing in better tools, and investing in our officers. We should be backing the blue and supporting those that protect and serve.

We, as Americans, should all have their back. After all, they’re the ones out there putting their lives on the line to keep us and our families safe.

We must improve the consistency, timeliness, and reporting methods of funding allocations to ensure South Carolina receives every dollar of rightfully owed disaster relief funding.

During the pandemic, many consumers and small businesses have struggled to keep up with their bills--through no fault of their own--while debt collectors have seen record profits. Meanwhile, recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reporting reveals that its consumer complaint database received 82,700 consumer complaints regarding debt collection issues in 2020, a 10% increase from the previous year. In addition, research has shown that that abusive debt collection practices disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities.

Reform of our debt collection laws is long overdue, and this legislation is a great first step. I plan to vote to pass it and send it to the Senate, who should not hesitate to bring it to a vote.
