His lockdown policies were not justified by the scientific data. He was somebody that fearmongered about schools. He did not support Florida when we had our kids in school in person. I think he was wrong about masks and asymptomatic spread. And obviously he did so many interviews that it was clear to me after pretty short time this was all about himself and his own image and for me, a look at that magazine cover it with him lounging by the pool with the sunglasses on, you know, right in the midst of a pandemic and it was almost like a let them eat cake moment for all of the people who were chaffing under his lockdowns and get he seemed to be having the time of his life.\"",
