393,Jeff Duncan,House,Republican,SC,3,2021-05-12 10:47:16.000000,"So - this morning, the House Republican Conference voted to remove Congresswoman Liz Cheney from her post as Conference Chair. You may wonder, why?

After the January 6th events at the United States Capitol, which saw former President Trump Impeached; saw fencing and razor wire erected by Speaker Pelosi around the Capitol complex (fencing is still up around the Capitol); and the National Guard called in as a deterrent against any future riotous protests (they are still here, btw), Representative/Chairwoman Cheney (R-WY) made comments on the events, about former President Trump and had voted to Impeach.

I believe she had the right to cast a vote of conscience during the impeachment process. That vote is between her and the constituency in Wyoming. She also has the right to have an opinion about former President Trump, as well as an opinion about the events of January 6th. Again, that is, and will be, between her and the Wyoming voters.

So, here is the rub which caused the movement for change within the Republican Conference: Liz Cheney was Chairwoman of the Conference. When she spoke, as a leader, she should be cognizant that her words might be construed as reflecting the opinion/will of the whole Republican Conference. They did not. In addition, she was defiant and showed no humility when a large majority of the Conference asked her to clarify, retract or differentiate between personal feelings and those of Republicans as a whole.

I believe, as we see too often in “the Swamp,” that Representative Cheney lost touch with the average American voter - those men and women who work hard, mow their own lawns, and maybe even enjoy writing their name on a dollar bill and sticking on the wall of a bar somewhere.

Those voters may have cringed over how former President Trump said things at times. But those same men and women really liked what he had done and was doing to return America to its rightful role as a world-leading nation versus the global apologetic nation we saw under the Obama Administration (and are seeing return under Joe Biden).

In her statement today, Representative Cheney tries to define the Republican Party, conservatism, and how she views the Constitution. She also tries to paint former President Trump as someone who doesn’t believe in the Constitution. She seems to fail at an understanding that her words, as Chairwoman, were construed to be those of the Conference.

Let me say this to Liz (whom I really like as a person, would have supported as a WY Senator had my dear friend Cynthia Lummis not ran for, and won, that Senate seat:

Conservatism is about limited government, free markets and individual liberties. Conservatives believe in a strong military, as you do. But Conservatives also are frustrated after 20 years of war. Conservatives are tired of the Washington spending as well as the intrusion on our liberties and federalism as our Founders envisioned. Conservatives, and most Republicans of all flavors liked what the Trump POLICIES were doing for our nation, our families, our businesses, and our communities.

So - if we are going to attempt to redefine the GOP, we would do good to remember that those policies and a return to Liberty are important for, not only the success of the nation, but for success of our GOP.",222,0,1225,0,RepJeffDuncan,Facebook,https://facebook.com/RepJeffDuncan/posts/6005628826121486,,,morning house republican conference voted remove congresswoman liz cheney post conference

Last month when the CDC issued new guidance on mask wearing, they stated that ""less than 10 percent"" of COVID-19 transmissions took place outdoors. Well, it turns out that number is extremely deceptive. In fact, there's not a single confirmed COVID case in the United States where someone caught the virus by just walking past someone while outside. And while there have been some cases of it spreading outdoors, they are VERY rare. Not only do virologists think ""the less than 10% number"" is too high, many believe that number to be below 1%, possibly as low as .1%. That's a major misrepresentation of the risks of spread!

From the NYT: ""Saying that less than 10 percent of Covid transmission occurs outdoors is akin to saying that sharks attack fewer than 20,000 swimmers a year. (The actual worldwide number is around 150.) It's both true and deceiving).

I endorse Secretary of State Blinken’s call for the immediate de-escalation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas to protect the lives of innocent civilians. Israel is fully within its rights to take measures to defend itself against the rocket assault launched by Hamas terrorists. The latest attacks also underscore the importance of the Iron Dome defense system.

Hamas’s actions only serve to undermine the pursuit of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people. Both Israelis and Palestinians have a right to live in security, a right to self-determination, and a right to have their human rights protected.

Sadly, we have seen this violent cycle too many times before, and we know it does not resolve the grievances of any side. It only leaves death and destruction in its wake. No parent wants to raise a child in a generation under fire that believes peace is not possible, views a neighbor as an enemy or a threat, or feels their basic humanity is in question. We must all be focused on actions that show the way out of this darkness.

The United States and its allies need to work with the parties to end the immediate violence and help create a path toward a future where both Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and dignity.

If you're a police officer, you know that every encounter you have has the potential to be deadly. That's the sad reality that our law enforcement officers have to deal with every single day.

I doubt there will be any mass protests over Luca's death, but his life definitely mattered as well. There are those who want our law enforcement defunded. Those who want to make it even harder for people like Luca to do their job effectively while at the same time protecting themselves. However, nearly all of those who fly the banner of defunding the police have never held a job as dangerous or demanding as our heroes in blue.

As a former member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I have long been a supporter of increased investment in our cybersecurity infrastructure. As a nation, we have underinvested in cybersecurity which has left us vulnerable to foreign hackers.

The adverse impacts of this attack are being felt across the East Coast, and in our daily lives, especially in Georgia. Gas prices have risen sharply and a report this morning found that 15% of gas stations in Georgia are without fuel. While the Colonial Pipeline expects to restart services soon, the Biden Administration is working diligently to increase the supply of gas to Georgia. The Department of Transportation has issued a temporary hours of service exemption to provide greater flexibility to motor carriers and drivers transporting gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined petroleum products. Additionally, the Administration supported Georgia’s waiver to allow higher weight limits for fuel tank trucks.

I will continue to closely monitor the situation and support efforts at the federal, state, and local levels to provide relief to those most affected by this attack.

Further complicating our domestic fuel situation is the disturbing and disruptive ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, which has sparked fear and caused the declaration of a state of emergency in many states, including Florida. We need to support commonsense, bipartisan cybersecurity solutions to protect our nation’s energy infrastructure and pipelines. Additionally, we must advance energy policies that lower costs for consumers, promote energy independence, and strengthen our energy infrastructure. Instead of working toward this goal, President Biden has taken the exact opposite approach.

273,Grace F. Napolitano,House,Democrat,CA,32,2021-05-12 19:31:37.000000,"BREAKING NEWS! The Mental Health Services for Students Act (H.R. 721), authored by myself and Congressman John Katko, passed the House today with overwhelming support!

This is a critical step toward our goal of ensuring every student in America, regardless of socioeconomic status, ethnicity, or ZIP code, has access to life-saving mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

In passing it during #mentalhealthawarenessmonth💚 we are tackling two of the biggest obstacles to care that existed long before COVID—stigma & lack of funding—and sending a resounding message from the halls of Congress that it is always okay to ask for help.

I am grateful to my constituents, House colleagues, and the countless mental health professionals and advocates who contributed toward today’s passage, giving youth mental health the attention it has long needed and deserves.

The American Rescue Plan makes critical investments to meet the health and economic needs of our seniors, such as improving mental health care, caregiver support, and increased access to vaccines.

For Florida's seniors, the plan includes:

$56.6 million for meals for older adults in Florida;
$34.7 million for Home and Community Based Services
$3.3 million for health promotion and disease prevention in Florida;
$12 million to help family caregivers support their loved ones; and

After experiencing the tragic loss of his daughter, Stephanie, in 1993, Gene and his family dedicated themselves to advocating for crime victims and their families.

Gene and his wife, Peggy, traveled the country speaking out for victims’ rights, organized the Speak Out for Stephanie foundation to create greater public awareness regarding sex offenders and created the Stephanie Schmidt Task Force for Victims’ Rights to develop recommendations for changes in the law. Due to their efforts, the Stephanie Schmidt Sexual Predator Act was signed into law and Kansas became a pioneer for victims’ rights legislation.

Gene and Peggy have been nationally recognized for their relentless activism in Stephanie’s memory through the National Crime Victims’ Service Award and the Attorney General’s Distinguished Service Award.

I was thankful to know him and am sending my sincere condolences to his family. Read more about Schmidt’s work in this story recognizing the 20th anniversary of Stephanie’s death: https://www.kansascitymag.com/girl-interrupted/
