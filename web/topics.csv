Trump and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea turned over 55 sets of remains of American service members killed during the Korean War. The remains arrived at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, on August 1st, 2018, and were subsequently accessioned into the DPAA laboratory for identification. Using laboratory analysis and circumstantial evidence, DPAA analysts identified CPL McCollum from among these remains.

CPL McCollum was a member of Company D, 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, 31st Regimental Combat Team. He was reported missing in action December 2nd, 1950, in the vicinity of the Chosin Reservoir, North Korea, when enemy forces attacked his unit. It was not until December 31st, 1953, that he was declared dead, with his family receiving an Army telegram. The location of his body, however, was unknown. As decades passed, Corporal McCollum’s family still hoped his remains would be returned home.

Without the sacrifice of heroes like CPL McCollum, freedom and liberty never would have been possible on the Korean peninsula. He is a true American hero, and we welcome him home to rest in peace.

CPL McCollum will be laid to rest at Dolly Cooper Cemetery in Anderson, SC, at 1 pm on Saturday, June 19th, his 90th birthday. He will also be lying in state from 8:30 am-5 pm on Friday, June 18th.

2884,Bill Johnson,House,Republican,OH,6,2021-06-18 12:20:00.000000,"“There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory.”

With that simple sentence in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, slavery was outlawed in a territory the size of the original 13 colonies. A year later, that territory would be settled permanently by the pioneers of the Ohio Company at Marietta, Ohio. Then, in 1862, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. But, word didn’t travel quite as quickly then as it does today. On June 19, 1865, two-and-a-half months after the Confederacy surrendered, an announcement by a Union Army general proclaimed freedom from slavery in Texas – the last enslaved people were freed and the scourge of slavery was ended.

Today we reflect on the fundamental truth that our inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that extend to all people, regardless of race, are not given to us by politicians or government; rather, they’re endowed to us by our Creator. This must be so, because if our rights were granted by government they could be taken by government.

America has made enormous progress on race and equality — an undeniable truth, but a truth too often muted by media and politicians who benefit politically and financially from stoking division.

We are a nation of fundamentally good people, our institutions are democratic, and our history is proud but not perfect.

This 2005 law provides the gun industry with an unprecedented immunity from liability that no other industry enjoys, and which has denied families their day in court. I introduced a bill to end this legal loophole and ensure the gun industry is held accountable when it acts with negligent disregard for public safety.

Join me and representatives from Guns Down America, Giffords, and Survivors Empowered on Monday, June 21st at 8:30pm ET for a LIVE virtual discussion on why must repeal PLCAA, hold the gun industry accountable, and give victims and survivors of gun violence their day in court.

Just as Americans learn the story of July 4, understanding and celebrating Juneteenth as a critical part of American history is vital. June 19 should be a national holiday – I was proud to vote in support of the bill to officially designate it as such, which just passed the Senate this week.

As America continues to grapple with systemic racism, a holiday centered on the story of the delayed promise of freedom has perhaps never been so apt. Take some time today to learn about the history of Juneteenth, celebrate freedom, and recommit to the ongoing work of securing true freedom for all Americans, no matter the color of their skin or their origin.

One of the most critical steps we can take to curb gun violence in America is repealing the law the NRA has called its “#1 priority,” but you’ve probably never heard of: the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). This 2005 law provides the gun industry with an unprecedented immunity from liability that no other industry enjoys, and which has denied families their day in court. I introduced a bill to end this legal loophole and ensure the gun industry is held accountable when it acts with negligent disregard for public safety.

This commemoration comes at a tenuous time in America, as it also marks one year since the largest civil rights marches in half a century following the murder of George Floyd. While one of the officers responsible for Floyd’s death has since been convicted, not nearly enough has been done to end systemic police brutality and reform the criminal justice system. That must include federal police reforms, but it must also involve dismantling the racism embedded within all American institutions. Equally important, we must acknowledge that we are facing an unprecedented attack on voting rights and take Federal action to stop it.

I’ve proudly cosponsored several bills, including H.R. 1 and H.R. 4, to establish federal protections and prevent institutional voter disenfranchisement. In addition to cosponsoring and authoring police reform and voting rights legislation, I proudly cosponsored and voted to pass Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee’s bill to recognize Juneteenth as a federal holiday. I am proud that President Joe Biden swiftly made this our 12th federal holiday, to mark the immense toll slavery took, and still exacts on our nation.

We are in the middle of a drought here in California, but we are releasing water from our dams into the ocean because of the ESA. Farmers can’t get water, so crops aren’t being planted. This means you will not see California agricultural products on your store shelves—you will have to settle for nothing or rely on expensive foreign imports. Forest thinning projects are being halted by lawsuits based on the ESA. While the necessary work is on hold pending a decision on a given lawsuit, wildfire comes through and wipes out the very habitats the litigants were trying to “protect.” How are megafires good for these species?

2422,Bill Johnson,House,Republican,OH,6,2021-06-20 13:33:19.152613,"Happy Father’s Day! For me, today is a day to reflect on just how important the role of a father is in the lives of his children. Some of you may know, I was raised in a dysfunctional home. My father was an alcoholic, and he struggled with addiction his entire life. Consequently, he was not there for me as a young boy when I needed him. Perhaps you can relate to this in your own life. Fortunately, for me, many strong men – both family and those I met in my military career – stepped in to fill the void. God used them greatly to mold and mentor me along the path life took me…and I’m extremely grateful for that. So, today I want to encourage all you fathers out there.

Several Bible verses come to mind this morning, but they are not traditional Father’s Day passages. But throughout this past week, I’ve been reminded of them often. I’ve now come to see that they are very appropriate verses for today. They come from the book of Ephesians…the Apostle Paul is encouraging the believers in the church at Ephesus. Though not directed specifically to fathers, they apply to all people…and I can think of no better encouragement to fathers who desire so strongly to be a positive influence in the lives of their children.

Ephesians 1:17 - I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.

Ephesians 4:1-2 - As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.

It takes a great deal of patience, love, and humility to be an effective father…especially in today’s world with all the demands on a father’s time and the many challenges our children face. I believe strongly that it takes God’s direct intervention in the lives of fathers to help them navigate the challenges of parenthood. So, if you are a father today, these are my prayers for you. First, that God would send his Holy Spirit to give you wisdom and revelation so that you can know him better. Because only by knowing God better can we, as fathers, meet the challenges ahead with confidence and purpose. And second, that you would be gentle, patient, loving, and humble in your role as father to your children. You will make mistakes, but by living out these attributes, the love you have for your children will ultimately claim the day. God bless you and have a great Father’s Day.",27,25,206,0,RepBillJohnson,Facebook,https://facebook.com/RepBillJohnson/posts/4802809349745653,,,happy fathers day today day reflect important role father lives children may know raised dysfunctional home father alcoholic struggled addiction entire life consequently young boy needed perhaps relate life fortunately many strong men family met military career stepped fill void god used greatly mold mentor along path life took meand im extremely grateful today want encourage fathers thereseveral bible verses come mind morning traditional fathers day passages throughout past week ive reminded often ive come see appropriate verses today come book ephesiansthe apostle paul encouraging believers church ephesus though directed specifically fathers apply peopleand think better encouragement fathers desire strongly positive influence lives childrenephesians keep asking god lord jesus christ glorious father may give spirit wisdom revelation may know betterephesians prisoner lord urge live life worthy calling received completely humble gentle patient bearing one another loveit takes great deal patience love humility effective fatherespecially todays world demands fathers time many challenges children face believe strongly takes gods direct intervention lives fathers help navigate challenges parenthood father today prayers first god would send holy spirit give wisdom revelation know better knowing god better fathers meet challenges ahead confidence purpose second would gentle patient loving humble role father children make mistakes living attributes love children ultimately claim day god bless great fathers day,"['happy', 'fathers', 'day', 'today', 'day', 'reflect', 'important', 'role', 'father', 'lives', 'children', 'may', 'know', 'raised', 'dysfunctional', 'home', 'father', 'alcoholic', 'struggled', 'addiction', 'entire', 'life', 'consequently', 'young', 'boy', 'needed', 'perhaps', 'relate', 'life', 'fortunately', 'many', 'strong', 'men', 'family', 'met', 'military', 'career', 'stepped', 'fill', 'void', 'god', 'used', 'greatly', 'mold', 'mentor', 'along', 'path', 'life', 'took', 'meand', 'im', 'extremely', 'grateful', 'today', 'want', 'encourage', 'fathers', 'thereseveral', 'bible', 'verses', 'come', 'mind', 'morning', 'traditional', 'fathers', 'day', 'passages', 'throughout', 'past', 'week', 'ive', 'reminded', 'often', 'ive', 'come', 'see', 'appropriate', 'verses', 'today', 'come', 'book', 'ephesiansthe', 'apostle', 'paul', 'encouraging', 'believers', 'church', 'ephesus', 'though', 'directed', 'specifically', 'fathers', 'apply', 'peopleand', 'think', 'better', 'encouragement', 'fathers', 'desire', 'strongly', 'positive', 'influence', 'lives', 'childrenephesians', 'keep', 'asking', 'god', 'lord', 'jesus', 'christ', 'glorious', 'father', 'may', 'give', 'spirit', 'wisdom', 'revelation', 'may', 'know', 'betterephesians', 'prisoner', 'lord', 'urge', 'live', 'life', 'worthy', 'calling', 'received', 'completely', 'humble', 'gentle', 'patient', 'bearing', 'one', 'another', 'loveit', 'takes', 'great', 'deal', 'patience', 'love', 'humility', 'effective', 'fatherespecially', 'todays', 'world', 'demands', 'fathers', 'time', 'many', 'challenges', 'children', 'face', 'believe', 'strongly', 'takes', 'gods', 'direct', 'intervention', 'lives', 'fathers', 'help', 'navigate', 'challenges', 'parenthood', 'father', 'today', 'prayers', 'first', 'god', 'would', 'send', 'holy', 'spirit', 'give', 'wisdom', 'revelation', 'know', 'better', 'knowing', 'god', 'better', 'fathers', 'meet', 'challenges', 'ahead', 'confidence', 'purpose', 'second', 'would', 'gentle', 'patient', 'loving', 'humble', 'role', 'father', 'children', 'make', 'mistakes', 'living', 'attributes', 'love', 'children', 'ultimately', 'claim', 'day', 'god', 'bless', 'great', 'fathers', 'day']",27,258,115720

Last month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced that over 180,000 illegal aliens were encountered at the southern border in May. This is a 674% increase from May 2020.

What is most outrageous about this situation is the Biden-Harris Administration’s policy change that no longer detains illegal aliens who are captured illegally crossing the border. Instead, they are processed, given a simple piece of paper requesting that they report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a later date, and then released into the U.S. mainland.

In reality, this new policy functionally opens our border and allows a free flow of illegal migrants into our country. This is particularly dangerous given the fact that drug cartels and trans-national criminal gangs are known to take advantage of our open border policies to traffic in deadly drugs and innocent human beings.

This is completely unacceptable. I will continue to stand up for proven methods that reduce illegal immigration that were in place during the Trump Administration: Constructing a border wall, reinstating the Migrant Protection Protocols, and deporting criminal illegal aliens.

I was so proud to cast my vote this week to make a national holiday of the day we finally cast off the shameful pall of slavery. I’m also proud that Pennsylvania was a thought center of the American abolitionist movement. If you visit the Library Company of Philadelphia, you can see and touch the original signed Act that abolished slavery in our Commonwealth, the first place in America to take that step. That was in 1780, even before the end of the Revolutionary War.

In the 8th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, we have a particular reason to smile at the Juneteenth holiday, since we actually served as a stop on the Underground Railroad. Waverly, PA, proudly lays claim to having assisted many fugitive slaves on their way to freedom, several of whom liked our area so much they chose to live out their lives there.

Millions of Americans and Canadians are counting on our governments to work together to reach an agreement that provides a clear roadmap for reopening the border between our two nations. The lack of transparency surrounding these negotiations is a disservice to our constituents and the millions of residents on both sides of the border waiting to see their loved ones, visit their property, and renew business ties. While the arrival of vaccines in record time has been a modern marvel, the inability of the U.S. and Canadian governments to reach an agreement on alleviating border restrictions or aligning additional essential traveler classes is simply unacceptable.

President Joe Biden
June 19 at 11:31 AM ·

Our hearts are heavy today as we let you all know that our beloved German Shepherd, Champ, passed away peacefully at home. He was our constant, cherished companion during the last 13 years and was adored by the entire Biden family. Even as Champ’s strength waned in his last months, when we came into a room, he would immediately pull himself up, his tail always wagging, and nuzzle us for an ear scratch or a belly rub. Wherever we were, he wanted to be, and everything was instantly better when he was next to us. He loved nothing more than curling up at our feet in front of a fire at the end of the day, joining us as a comforting presence in meetings, or sunning himself in the White House garden. In his younger days, he was happiest chasing golf balls on the front lawn of the Naval Observatory or racing to catch our grandchildren as they ran around our backyard in Delaware. In our most joyful moments and in our most grief-stricken days, he was there with us, sensitive to our every unspoken feeling and emotion. We love our sweet, good boy and will miss him always.",9,3,127,0,RepJoshG,Facebook,https://facebook.com/RepJoshG/posts/1462107017460694,https://scontent-iad3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/201525526_248579833885219_4970653731767076767_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=vTxG_6UCRHIAX-Hm2Cv&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.xx&tp=14&oh=254012ab739534843c9d722369763f02&oe=60D4ACA3,,heart goes president first lady whole family rest easy champpresident joe bidenjune hearts heavy today let know beloved german shepherd champ passed away peacefully home constant cherished companion last years adored entire biden family even champs strength waned last months came room would immediately pull tail always wagging nuzzle us ear scratch belly rub wherever wanted everything instantly better next us loved nothing curling feet front fire end day joining us comforting presence meetings sunning white house garden younger days happiest chasing golf balls front lawn naval observatory racing catch grandchildren ran around backyard delaware joyful moments griefstricken days us sensitive every unspoken feeling emotion love sweet good boy miss always,"['heart', 'goes', 'president', 'first', 'lady', 'whole', 'family', 'rest', 'easy', 'champpresident', 'joe', 'bidenjune', 'hearts', 'heavy', 'today', 'let', 'know', 'beloved', 'german', 'shepherd', 'champ', 'passed', 'away', 'peacefully', 'home', 'constant', 'cherished', 'companion', 'last', 'years', 'adored', 'entire', 'biden', 'family', 'even', 'champs', 'strength', 'waned', 'last', 'months', 'came', 'room', 'would', 'immediately', 'pull', 'tail', 'always', 'wagging', 'nuzzle', 'us', 'ear', 'scratch', 'belly', 'rub', 'wherever', 'wanted', 'everything', 'instantly', 'better', 'next', 'us', 'loved', 'nothing', 'curling', 'feet', 'front', 'fire', 'end', 'day', 'joining', 'us', 'comforting', 'presence', 'meetings', 'sunning', 'white', 'house', 'garden', 'younger', 'days', 'happiest', 'chasing', 'golf', 'balls', 'front', 'lawn', 'naval', 'observatory', 'racing', 'catch', 'grandchildren', 'ran', 'around', 'backyard', 'delaware', 'joyful', 'moments', 'griefstricken', 'days', 'us', 'sensitive', 'every', 'unspoken', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'love', 'sweet', 'good', 'boy', 'miss', 'always']",27,139,115720

Right now, the Social Security Fairness Act currently has 167 bipartisan cosponsors. I will continue working with members of both political parties so that we can reach 290 cosponsors. We're not stopping until leadership of the U.S. House brings the bill to the floor for a vote.

I have co-authored this legislation to fix this penalty, which punishes tens of thousands of Louisiana public servants. We continue pushing for the House to vote on this legislation and if it passes, Louisiana's dedicated public servants and their spouses or survivors will receive the full retirement benefits they deserve, including those who have already retired. It remains among my greatest priorities in Congress.

Public servants in Louisiana (teachers, firefighters, etc.) are some of the most impacted victims of the infamous WEP and GPO – a flawed federal law that can result in massive cuts in their Social Security retirement.

Although the United States identifies as the land of the free, for over 400 years it was far from that for too many. We need to teach and understand the significance and history of Juneteenth, and our schools need to accurately incorporate this history into curriculums for a deeper understanding of our nation’s history.

I’m glad to see we are recognizing the day as a federal holiday but we still have a lot of work to do to in order to achieve true justice and equality for all Americans, such as protecting the right to vote.

This week's ruling on the Affordable Care Act highlights the need for us to find bipartisan solutions to improve the quality of American health care, especially in light of premium increases and quality of care decline that was caused by the one-sized-fits-all nature of the Affordable Care Act.

To that end, I have introduced several bipartisan bills that empower patients by giving them more choice over their health care in addition to increasing access to care through telehealth and by expanding tax-advantaged health-savings accounts. I look forward to continuing to be a leader on these important issues and working across the aisle to find common-sense solutions for hard-working Americans.

Over the past year, our nation has faced a reckoning on racism and the structural injustices that still permeate our society.

We must continue to find ways to right our historical wrongs, lift our voices, and share our stories. As part of our healing, we must continue to come together and fight for a more perfect union and a more equitable tomorrow.

This week, the House and the Senate passed legislation making Juneteenth a federal holiday, and President Biden signed it into law. This is a historic moment for America, and we will continue to move forward together.

156 years later, Congress has recognized the long-standing tradition among Black Americans to memorialize the end of slavery by establishing Juneteenth National Independence Day as a federal holiday. This day marks one of the most important moments in our country's history. It was the starting point on a path to equal justice under the law and equitable opportunity for all in America, that continues even today.

This Juneteenth arrives at a time when the national conversation on police brutality, criminal justice, health care and social services access, infrastructure investment, and good governance acknowledges the reality of systemic racism, which disproportionately places the heaviest burdens and the harshest penalties on Black people. Change is long overdue. Commemoration alone is not enough to rid the country of the existing legacies of slavery especially in light of unprecedented attacks on the right to vote and recognition of our country’s history of slavery in state legislatures across the country.

I am proud and grateful to join in celebrating Juneteenth with my friend LaNesha DeBardelaben, the Northwest African American Museum, Rec'N The Streets, and many others on a day that symbolizes the beginning of freedom for so many Black Americans.

Why June 19th? Because on June 19, 1865, Union General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas and informed all enslaved people in Texas that they were now free. Even though the Civil War had been over for more than two months and President Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation two and a half years earlier, many African Americans remained enslaved until the Union Army arrived to enforce the law. As a result, African Americans in Galveston have celebrated their emancipation on Juneteenth (June 19th) every year.

For more than 150 years that initially local celebration has spread far and wide, and become something of an unofficial national holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States. Well, now it’s official. Juneteenth commemorates an incredibly important milestone in our continuing effort to attain a more perfect union, by celebrating freedom, equality and basic human dignity.",24,3,25,0,RepSteveChabot,Facebook,https://facebook.com/RepSteveChabot/posts/6536680306357818,https://scontent-iad3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/203556219_6536655193026996_6903595465453892649_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=110474&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=uhD62cSAhHMAX_up9Do&_nc_oc=AQkYF60AZ7ItyAhq7Xq0NxviLITsJwZo3_2QnlVr9RUSWH-FO7xaPNQwvHQacCbSOD8&tn=y2s2WnlwfHqT9gxx&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.xx&tp=14&oh=19ab9097ec7da330ae20c3c275832b31&oe=60D596B1,,week congress passed president biden signed law legislation making juneteenth day originally set aside celebrate end slavery confederacy federal holidaywhy june 19th june union general gordon granger arrived galveston texas informed enslaved people texas free even though civil war two months president lincoln signed emancipation proclamation two half years earlier many african americans remained enslaved union army arrived enforce law result african americans galveston celebrated emancipation juneteenth june 19th every yearfor years initially local celebration spread far wide become something unofficial national holiday commemorating end slavery united states well official juneteenth commemorates incredibly important milestone continuing effort attain perfect union celebrating freedom equality basic human dignity,"['week', 'congress', 'passed', 'president', 'biden', 'signed', 'law', 'legislation', 'making', 'juneteenth', 'day', 'originally', 'set', 'aside', 'celebrate', 'end', 'slavery', 'confederacy', 'federal', 'holidaywhy', 'june', '19th', 'june', 'union', 'general', 'gordon', 'granger', 'arrived', 'galveston', 'texas', 'informed', 'enslaved', 'people', 'texas', 'free', 'even', 'though', 'civil', 'war', 'two', 'months', 'president', 'lincoln', 'signed', 'emancipation', 'proclamation', 'two', 'half', 'years', 'earlier', 'many', 'african', 'americans', 'remained', 'enslaved', 'union', 'army', 'arrived', 'enforce', 'law', 'result', 'african', 'americans', 'galveston', 'celebrated', 'emancipation', 'juneteenth', 'june', '19th', 'every', 'yearfor', 'years', 'initially', 'local', 'celebration', 'spread', 'far', 'wide', 'become', 'something', 'unofficial', 'national', 'holiday', 'commemorating', 'end', 'slavery', 'united', 'states', 'well', 'official', 'juneteenth', 'commemorates', 'incredibly', 'important', 'milestone', 'continuing', 'effort', 'attain', 'perfect', 'union', 'celebrating', 'freedom', 'equality', 'basic', 'human', 'dignity']",07,52,115039

Yet the current child center is a failing, off-base facility with insufficient capacity.

That is why I requested $24 million to fund the construction of a new Child Development Center. This new facility would have the capacity for more than 300 children and include force protection features, and necessary spaces including classroom and play areas.

This is a desperately needed facility for Wright-Patt that I will work diligently to secure.

Before volunteering in the U.S. Army during WW2, he was a proud engineer and a union man in San Francisco in the 1930’s. He later retired from the re￼serves as a Colonel.

I wasn’t always close to my father, and we certainly had our share of disagreements, but I always respected him as my father and as a human, who – like all of us – had his strengths and weaknesses.

They say that the apple doesn’t falls far from the tree, and I see my father in myself more and more as I enter my seventh decade. Like many children, I’ve always wanted to make my father proud. I hope that I have lived up to his standards and his expectations of me because I truly believe the guiding principles he lived by make for a good person in any society.

Some of us are celebrating today with loved ones who are still with us. Some of us, like me, are missing the ones we’ve lost.

Already home to the National Weather Center, OU is certainly well positioned to host this research institute to improve the understanding of severe and high-impact weather. Indeed, the results of research efforts could pave the way for producing more accurate forecasts and warnings in the future, which would not only benefit Oklahomans – who know to expect severe weather – but all Americans in response to weather patterns. Indeed, with better forecasts and warnings, we can be better prepared for the worst and ultimately save lives and protect property. I am proud to congratulate OU on its selection for this worthwhile research effort.

On Friday, June 18, 2021 from 11:00 AM – 12:00 PM, U.S. Representative Brenda L. Lawrence (MI-14), U.S. Representative Lee Zeldin, and U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz will host a virtual roundtable to discuss political and social issues following the 1865 notification of the emancipation of slavery, and how we can use our diversity of voices through allyship today and tomorrow to lift up one another. Rep. Lawrence will be joined by distinguished panelists Joi Chaney, Dov Wilker, and Kinshasha Holman Conwill. The virtual roundtable will be hosted virtually via Zoom webinar, and members of the press will be allowed to ask questions. A recording of the virtual roundtable will be provided to participating press after the event.

A personal note to my friends and neighbors:

I frequently reach out to you to communicate politically themed messages or request your counsel regarding the same. But today’s message is for a different purpose… to relay some personal information.

No one likes to hear the “C” word, especially when having a discussion with their physician, but as many of you have previously experienced… sometimes it happens. I recently learned that there is cancer in a portion of my renal system.
The good news is: My case is treatable, and I anticipate a full recovery. Throughout the treatment process I will be diligent in continuing my congressional duties.

As a Christian, I believe things happen for a reason. This is a time for me to learn and grow from what many of you already have personal appreciation for. By the time it’s over I will be better educated, have more compassion for those with similar experiences, have increased appreciation for our healthcare system, and be a better person!

As always, should you need assistance working through federal issues or have policy concerns, do not hesitate to contact one of my offices. Thank you for your understanding, and your prayers!",3,1,25,0,96007744606,Facebook,https://facebook.com/96007744606/posts/10158362372484607,,,russ dear friend begins new fight know hell determination fights idahoans everyday nations capital id ask join kathy pray health give family privacy deserve idaho needs russrep russ fulcherjune pm personal note friends neighborsi frequently reach communicate politically themed messages request counsel regarding todays message different purpose relay personal informationno one likes hear c word especially discussion physician many previously experienced sometimes happens recently learned cancer portion renal systemthe good news case treatable anticipate full recovery throughout treatment process diligent continuing congressional dutiesas christian believe things happen reason time learn grow many already personal appreciation time better educated compassion similar experiences increased appreciation healthcare system better personas always need assistance working federal issues policy concerns hesitate contact one offices thank understanding prayers,"['russ', 'dear', 'friend', 'begins', 'new', 'fight', 'know', 'hell', 'determination', 'fights', 'idahoans', 'everyday', 'nations', 'capital', 'id', 'ask', 'join', 'kathy', 'pray', 'health', 'give', 'family', 'privacy', 'deserve', 'idaho', 'needs', 'russrep', 'russ', 'fulcherjune', 'pm', 'personal', 'note', 'friends', 'neighborsi', 'frequently', 'reach', 'communicate', 'politically', 'themed', 'messages', 'request', 'counsel', 'regarding', 'todays', 'message', 'different', 'purpose', 'relay', 'personal', 'informationno', 'one', 'likes', 'hear', 'c', 'word', 'especially', 'discussion', 'physician', 'many', 'previously', 'experienced', 'sometimes', 'happens', 'recently', 'learned', 'cancer', 'portion', 'renal', 'systemthe', 'good', 'news', 'case', 'treatable', 'anticipate', 'full', 'recovery', 'throughout', 'treatment', 'process', 'diligent', 'continuing', 'congressional', 'dutiesas', 'christian', 'believe', 'things', 'happen', 'reason', 'time', 'learn', 'grow', 'many', 'already', 'personal', 'appreciation', 'time', 'better', 'educated', 'compassion', 'similar', 'experiences', 'increased', 'appreciation', 'healthcare', 'system', 'better', 'personas', 'always', 'need', 'assistance', 'working', 'federal', 'issues', 'policy', 'concerns', 'hesitate', 'contact', 'one', 'offices', 'thank', 'understanding', 'prayers']",27,29,115720

2793,Jeff Fortenberry,House,Republican,NE,1,2021-06-18 17:25:00.000000,"FORT REPORT: FIXING A HOLE

This Fort Report is far away from your concerns in Nebraska, but it’s important. When I was a college student, I took part in an exchange program in Egypt. I lived among the poor, with farmers, with the wealthy, with elected officials. I even sipped tea with the Bedouins in the Sinai Desert.

Fast forward forty years. As a Member of Congress on the Appropriations Subcommittee with oversight responsibility for the State Department and Foreign Operations, I am constantly considering matters of Middle East policy. On a fairly recent return trip to Egypt, I had a lengthy, encouraging visit with President Sisi, as well as meaningful dialogue with Egypt’s ancient Christian community and the Grand Imam of al-Azhar mosque. I took a side trip to the old marketplace where I spent time decades before. While walking along one of its narrow corridors, I stepped in a hole. I looked down and said to my host, ""I think I stepped in that hole forty years ago."" We laughed. In the Middle East, some holes are hard to fix.

In neighboring Israel, we recently watched another traumatic flareup of hostilities between Israelis and Palestinians. For years, politicians have touted ""the road map for peace."" But, as I have often said, every road needs a foundation.

Some time ago, a proposed a new idea called the Middle East Partnership for Peace Act to reestablish the preconditions of trust as a foundation for lasting peace. I am pleased to report that due to a concerted leadership push by former Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey of New York, the Nita Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act (MEPPA) is now law.

Given the recent Egypt-orchestrated ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians, the pressing need for transformative ideas for peacebuilding, and a shifting political environment, implementation of MEPPA is now a ripe policy consideration. MEPPA does two things: it builds trust through traditional people-to-people exchanges; it creatively deploys the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to jumpstart hugely beneficial private equity projects.

The business projects envisioned by MEPPA will have Israeli and Palestinian partners, with a particular focus on sustainable agriculture. The idea is that whether politics lurches left, lurches right, or something blows up, these profitable, mutually enriching ventures will be hard to unwind. The bill also has embedded safeguards to ensure that funds flow directly to these projects, not through governments, and not towards nefarious actors who could use the money to perpetuate violence.

From an initial concept over six years ago, we are now building out a MEPPA board, as we work to make an abstract policy idea real for people on the ground. In my recent exchanges with U.S. Secretary of State Blinken and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Power, there was strong agreement about the importance of this new tool.

I realize that your personal considerations are very far from these foreign policy dynamics. But this work for peace is ultimately about creating stability to protect us all. More people lost their lives to war in the 20th century than in all other wars in human history. While we consider ourselves modern and advanced, violence and the means of escalating violence are only increasing.

Tools like MEPPA, rooted in human relationship, understanding, respect, prosperity, and trust, offer another way––to build the foundation of the roadmap for peace. Maybe that hole I stepped in can finally get fixed too.

That is why I joined House and Senate Democrats to introduce the Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act on Wednesday.

The bill also makes Pell Grant funding fully mandatory to protect it from funding shortfalls. About 1,000 Northern Marianas College students each year pay for their tuition and other expenses with Pell grants.
