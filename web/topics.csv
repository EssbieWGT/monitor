China is our nation’s top threat, and the Chinese Communist Party is investing in the People’s Liberation Army at record rates. In our efforts to counter China’s quest for global hegemony, it would be shortsighted to ramp up our domestic investments in technology without also increasing defense spending and leveraging our expansive defense research and development enterprise.

The best deterrent to Chinese ambition and aggression is a strong and feared American military. Providing the funding increases our military needs to counter this growing threat must be our highest priority. Providing the funding increases our military needs to counter this growing threat must be our highest priority.

Instead, President Biden’s budget proposes cutting defense while increasing non-defense spending by nearly 20 percent. His priorities are out of order — a strong military underpins everything else we do to push back on China. That is why our amendment provides dollar-for-dollar parity in increases between defense and non-defense spending. We encourage our Democratic colleagues to join us in this effort for a whole-of-government approach to Chinese aggression.

I’ve also heard from Kansans who need to make home improvements but the high price of lumber has made it unaffordable.

A civilian force improves the range of capabilities, streamlines operations beyond the Capitol, and would cost American taxpayers far less than the current proposal — and it’s what General Honoré’s task force recommends.

House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Congressman Mike D. Rogers and I oppose creating a D.C. National Guard Quick Reaction Force in the House’s emergency supplemental.

If Democrat leadership wants to spend an additional $200 million on the National Guard, it would be better spent on rebuilding Guard readiness that suffered as a result of this over-long deployment to Capitol Hill.

“What happened on January 6th was inexcusable and I wholeheartedly condemn the violence that occurred that day. After thoughtful consideration of this proposal, I decided to vote against this legislation.

If I thought that this commission would be non-political and truly get to the bottom of what happened that day, I would have been inclined to support this legislation. Based on history, however, I have deep concerns about the commission being used by Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats as a political tool against Republicans.

Additionally, there are already numerous Congressional and intergovernmental agencies conducting investigations into the events of that day, including two Senate Committees, the Architect of the Capitol, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I am confident these investigations will be thorough, and justice will be served. I am concerned this new commission might interfere with these ongoing investigations.”

They wanted me to have peace, security, good health, and opportunity. That’s what every parent wants for their child. If we can all focus on that as common ground, we should be able to move forward together.

How will we stop the cycle of violence when Palestinian children are not only witness to their parents being searched and humiliated, but children are being taken and detained themselves? And Israeli children grow up witnessing it, too? It creates another generation of violence.

Whether it’s in my country or Israel, when I see a human rights violation committed – I have an obligation, if I want a more just and more peaceful world for the future – to speak out on it.

I joined Tommy Vietor on Pod Save the World to discuss my bill, H.R. 2590, the violence in Gaza, and the need to end Israeli occupation in order to create the conditions for lasting peace.

To improve operations so that residents in Northwest Ohio receive their mail on time, I wrote a letter to the United States Postal Service (USPS) Postmaster General and Chief Executive Officer Louis DeJoy requesting an expansion of operations at the Toledo Processing and Distribution Center (P&DC) to allow for the permanent return of mail processing responsibilities for Northwest Ohio, instead of the USPS continuing to utilize the Michigan Metroplex Facility in Pontiac, Michigan for these duties.

That’s why any response can’t separate out military and economic competition – it must be whole of government, and right now, the U.S. Innovation and Competitiveness Act is only focused on economic competition, not military.

My amendment with Senator Shelby will make sure that any increase in non-defense discretionary spending is matched by the same level of increase to the defense spending — what's known as parity.

This isn't just a Republican priority — Democrats have supported parity for years. And it was the bipartisan National Defense Commission Report that called for real growth to the defense budget - a marker that President Biden's proposed budget doesn't meet.

Democrats alone would control the process for requesting information from federal agencies as well as selecting key staff positions within the commission. With one party controlling the information as well as senior staff, I don’t believe an objective, non-partisan conclusion can be delivered by the commission as the legislation is currently written. If the Senate were to address these concerns and send amended legislation back to the House, I would give serious consideration to supporting it.
