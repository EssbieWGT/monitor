It should the goal of every policy maker who wants to see America strong to promote American energy and infrastructure so that we can again be the leading producer of all-of-the-above energy resources.

The Colonial Pipeline shutdown demonstrated we need more pipelines, not fewer. We need more domestically-produced oil and natural gas, not less. Biden’s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm even said “pipe is the best way” to transport American energy. If only that sentiment was realized in federal policy. Instead, the Biden administration has put forward backward, harmful and non-sensical policies—canceling the U.S. Keystone Pipeline but green-lighting Russia’s Nord Stream II Pipeline to Germany.

Between the consumer and the producer sit four large beef packing companies that control over 80% of the processing market. These four packers seemingly are able to control prices at their will, and thus have realized significant profits, while both U.S. beef consumers and independent cattle producers pay the price.

The time has come to fix this. U.S. Senator Tina Smith and I are launching a bipartisan, nationwide effort to defend our consumers and cattlemen. We have announced that we will be sending a letter to the Department of Justice asking them to examine whether the control meatpackers have of the beef processing market violates U.S. antitrust laws. We are asking members of Congress - House and Senate, Republican and Democrat - to support this effort.

Senator Jerry Moran
May 20 at 2:06 PM ·

It’s time to reopen the U.S. Capitol Complex.

On March 12, 2020, as COVID-19 was beginning to spread through the country, the U.S. Capitol closed its doors to visitors. This morning, I led a letter with Senator Jim Inhofe to Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer to reopen the U.S. Capitol to visitors following CDC guidance that people fully-vaccinated against COVID-19 can gather indoors and outdoors without masks.

The coronavirus is in retreat across the country, thanks to widespread vaccination efforts and hard work by our medical professionals. This fact should be celebrated and reflected by welcoming citizens back to our workplace.

The U.S. Capitol has long symbolized our American form of democracy, with involvement from the citizens of this country a key principle of our government. As COVID-19 subsides in America, it is important to remember why the Capitol was open to the people in the first place. American citizens’ involvement in government requires access to their members of Congress, making reopening the Capitol Complex an issue of great importance.

Let Congress be an example for this country by lifting the COVID-19 restrictions barring people from entering the Capitol Complex, which should once again be open to those we serve.",58,2,115,0,jiminhofe,Facebook,https://facebook.com/jiminhofe/posts/10158322729369422,https://scontent-iad3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/188837719_10158461059932106_8786517280405962971_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=jDIfTam1FGMAX83kuxN&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.xx&tp=14&oh=bfeceb3d7782593f44e7ba9fd34ef1cb&oe=60CF9942,https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sens-inhofe-moran-its-time-to-reopen-the-us-capitol,past time reopen capitol american peopleread full letter senator jerry moran wrote belowsenator jerry moranmay pm time reopen us capitol complexon march covid19 beginning spread country us capitol closed doors visitors morning led letter senator jim inhofe speaker pelosi leader schumer reopen us capitol visitors following cdc guidance people fullyvaccinated covid19 gather indoors outdoors without masksthe coronavirus retreat across country thanks widespread vaccination efforts hard work medical professionals fact celebrated reflected welcoming citizens back workplacethe us capitol long symbolized american form democracy involvement citizens country key principle government covid19 subsides america important remember capitol open people first place american citizens involvement government requires access members congress making reopening capitol complex issue great importancelet congress example country lifting covid19 restrictions barring people entering capitol complex open serve,"['past', 'time', 'reopen', 'capitol', 'american', 'peopleread', 'full', 'letter', 'senator', 'jerry', 'moran', 'wrote', 'belowsenator', 'jerry', 'moranmay', 'pm', 'time', 'reopen', 'us', 'capitol', 'complexon', 'march', 'covid19', 'beginning', 'spread', 'country', 'us', 'capitol', 'closed', 'doors', 'visitors', 'morning', 'led', 'letter', 'senator', 'jim', 'inhofe', 'speaker', 'pelosi', 'leader', 'schumer', 'reopen', 'us', 'capitol', 'visitors', 'following', 'cdc', 'guidance', 'people', 'fullyvaccinated', 'covid19', 'gather', 'indoors', 'outdoors', 'without', 'masksthe', 'coronavirus', 'retreat', 'across', 'country', 'thanks', 'widespread', 'vaccination', 'efforts', 'hard', 'work', 'medical', 'professionals', 'fact', 'celebrated', 'reflected', 'welcoming', 'citizens', 'back', 'workplacethe', 'us', 'capitol', 'long', 'symbolized', 'american', 'form', 'democracy', 'involvement', 'citizens', 'country', 'key', 'principle', 'government', 'covid19', 'subsides', 'america', 'important', 'remember', 'capitol', 'open', 'people', 'first', 'place', 'american', 'citizens', 'involvement', 'government', 'requires', 'access', 'members', 'congress', 'making', 'reopening', 'capitol', 'complex', 'issue', 'great', 'importancelet', 'congress', 'example', 'country', 'lifting', 'covid19', 'restrictions', 'barring', 'people', 'entering', 'capitol', 'complex', 'open', 'serve']",27,175,7528

288,Dan Sullivan,Senate,Republican,AK,,2021-05-21 13:09:27,"I was honored to host Admiral John C. Aquilino, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), for his first-ever visit to Alaska last weekend. Admiral Aquilino was in Alaska to observe the men and women of INDOPACOM execute Northern Edge, a 12-day biennial field exercise that leverages Alaska’s vast terrain and waters to train our military. The exercise utilized more than 13,000 Navy, Air Force, Army, and Marine personnel, 247 aircraft, and 6 ships to test warfighting capabilities and incorporate new emerging technologies, all centered on the incredible, world-class military training our state has to offer.

During his visit, Admiral Aquilino saw what Alaskans, as well as our adversaries like Putin and Xi, have been witnessing—extraordinary growth in military construction, personnel and aircraft in our great state. Eielson alone is slated to receive 54 F-35s and four additional KC-135 tankers, a 200%+ increase in the number of aircraft based there. This development is the result of our state’s unrivaled strategic location, its premier training ranges and opportunities, and the unique support offered by Alaska’s patriotic communities.

There are also many dedicated business leaders and local citizens in Pittsburg that work day in and day out to make this community special for the people that choose to live in southeast Kansas. They have worked hard to make this a hub of economic activity, and good things continue to happen in Pittsburg as a result.

I also had the opportunity to surprise a member of my senior staff, Pam Henderson, with the Spirit of Pittsburg award. Presented each year by the chamber, this award is meant to recognize an individual that goes above and beyond, often working behind the scenes for events, boards and organizations in the effort to better the community.

I remain optimistic that my bill will allow Alaskans to have some semblance of a tourism season in Alaska.

198,John Boozman,Senate,Republican,AR,,2021-05-22 12:10:38,"We’ve wrapped up another busy week, so that means it’s time for a round-up of what I’ve been up to and some of the issues I’ve been engaged on as your United States Senator for Arkansas. Here’s the recap:

-> There’s been increased violence and terrorism in Israel that started earlier this month. Hamas, the military Islamist group that rules Gaza, fired rockets into Israeli cities. I’ve been a vocal advocate of standing with Israel, especially in its hour of need. I joined many of my GOP colleagues in supporting a resolution condemning the attacks against Israel by Hamas, an Iranian-backed and funded terrorist organization, and reaffirming the United States’ unwavering commitment to our ally Israel and its right to take whatever means are necessary to stop the murder of its citizens and foreign nationals residing in Israel: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=6DFA7E46-810C-4A3D-99C2-EB6E9A351DCF

-> As the Republican leader of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I was pleased to invite two Arkansans to testify at a hearing the committee held this week on protecting forestland. Having the Natural State’s forestry sector represented in a meaningful way amid the ongoing discussion about proper forest management is significant. More than half of our state is forested, and the wood products industry is responsible for tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in income in the Natural State. Hearing from experts like Arkansas Forestry Division State Forester and President of the National Association of State Foresters, Joe Fox, and Director of Forestry at Winrock International’s American Carbon Registry, Jessica Orrego, was incredibly valuable for my colleagues and me. Read more from SWARK Today ’s article: https://swark.today/boozman-hosts-forestry-industry-experts-from-arkansas-at-senate-ag-committee/

-> I joined Senators Cotton and Inhofe to announce a new bill to designate U.S. Highway 412, from Interstate 35 in Noble County, Okla., to Interstate 49 in Springdale, as a future interstate. Connecting Northwest Arkansas and North Central Oklahoma will encourage economic development along this corridor and expand opportunities for employment in the region. We believe the future interstate designation for U.S. 412 is needed to keep pace with the economic growth in both regions. 5NEWS has more: https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/local/us-legislators-look-to-designate-part-of-highway-412-as-future-interstate/527-bf4afb03-0de1-494c-9b4e-4544ef032433

-> Our First Amendment freedoms are fundamental, yet during the Obama administration the IRS targeted and punished Americans engaged in protected speech. That was inexcusable and condemnable. Over 40 of my Senate GOP colleagues and I have introduced legislation to prevent the Internal Revenue Service from being used as a political weapon against American citizens. The Trump administration installed necessary safeguards to prohibit such conduct, but Democrats’ latest elections overhaul bill seeks to undermine these needed prohibitions. The ""Don’t Weaponize the IRS Act"" protects every American’s personal information from being used for the purposes of political harassment and retribution: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=B81E7BE2-56C7-4FFE-BC9B-AC5DABA93813

-> Pres. Biden's court packing commission is holding its first meeting now. This blatant power grab should be dead on arrival. I've cosponsored a constitutional amendment to ensure the Supreme Court remains at 9 justices and free from partisan interference: https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/9?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22nine+justices%22%7D&s=2&r=1

-> The Rural Jobs Act, bipartisan legislation I helped introduce this week, builds on the momentum of the New Market Tax Credit to support job creation and economic opportunities in rural communities. I’m pleased to take this latest step in advocating for policies that reinvigorate investment in areas of Arkansas that need it most: https://www.ddtonline.com/politics-press-releases/sen-roger-wicker-lead-sponsor-rural-jobs-act-60a5246e2872f#sthash.iO6DiIpX.dpbs

-> Taxpayers' hard-earned income shouldn't be treated carelessly. It deserves to be used wisely and responsibly. The Citizens Against Government Waste has named me a ""Taxpayer Hero"" for protecting the money Arkansans send to the federal government. They deserve accountability, and I’m proud to being standing up for them in Washington, DC: https://www.ccagwratings.org/legislators

-> The Arkansas Air National Guard's 189th Airlift Wing at Little Rock Air Force Base will house the Air National Guard's C-130J Super Hercules training program. This is great news for Arkansas, the Arkansas Air National Guard and the community. The 189th Airlift Wing is an outstanding unit that has demonstrated its excellence and indispensability in maintaining our nation’s air superiority. The Air Force’s decision to station this new aircraft in the 189th ensures the squadron will continue to play a critical role in our nation’s defense well into the future.

-> The National Institutes of Health hosted a bipartisan group of senators at some of its facilities earlier this week and shared the results of federal investments, including COVID testing technologies and more. Our country's world-class research efforts and highly skilled personnel have helped solve incredible public health challenges this past year. Having the opportunity to learn more about this work up-close was informative and encouraging: https://twitter.com/JohnBoozman/status/1394761210688573447

-> Breeze Airways announced that it will fly three new, nonstop flights out of Northwest Arkansas National Airport beginning this summer to Tampa, San Antonio and New Orleans. I congratulated XNA Northwest Arkansas National Airport on this great news because connecting NWA, and our state, to other regional hubs will have a positive impact on economic growth and opportunity. Air travel is rebounding from a tough year and we’re excited XNA is playing its part in the comeback: https://twitter.com/JohnBoozman/status/1395740035819921415

-> It’s National #EMSWeek, which is a reminder that emergency medical workers are such vital parts of our communities, helping save lives and provide urgently needed care in times of crisis. They’re frontline heroes and we're grateful for what they do each day. This week, I joined so many others to say “Thank You”: https://twitter.com/JohnBoozman/status/1395037781320249346

-> I spoke at Subiaco Academy’s commencement ceremony last week. It was a real treat to be part of the school’s graduation ceremony on a beautiful day at such a unique, historic campus. I appreciated getting to share some advice and words of encouragement to celebrate this milestone, and am excited for these graduates and their families for what’s next: https://twitter.com/JohnBoozman/status/1393689367550562304

-> It's an exciting time for graduates wrapping up their study in the classroom. Congratulations to the Arkansas Colleges of Health Education Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine's inaugural class of osteopathic physicians who are standard-setters within this vitally important, game-changing institution. I shared some remarks about this important occasion in the Congressional Record, which you can read in the Southwest Times Record: https://www.swtimes.com/story/opinion/2021/05/19/op-ed-boozman-remarks-arcom-graduates-congressional-record/5131841001/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter

-> The The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) named me its 2021 Legislator of the Year during a virtual ceremony on Thursday for my “outstanding legislative contributions that impact cardiothoracic surgeons and their patients.” We’re living through some of the most challenging times many of us have ever experienced. The health care industry was tested in ways we never dreamed of, and it showed the resilience of physicians, medical providers, and their staff. To be recognized by STS at a time like this is something I will always be grateful for and will also serve as an inspiring reminder of the importance of supporting our health care professionals: https://www.sts.org/media/news-releases/sen-john-boozman-recognized-longstanding-commitment-health-care-policies

-> Yesterday, I stopped by Van Buren today to view tornado damage at the Crawford County Courthouse from earlier this month. We also met with and thanked EMT personnel for all their efforts since it’s #EMSWeek. Judge Dennis Gilstrap, Mayor Joe Hurst and I are thankful for them and all their counterparts.

-> I also took part in the grand opening of the new Mercy Hospital Fort Smith Rehabilitation Hospital. It was an exciting afternoon as we cut the ribbon on this new facility at Chaffee Crossing. So much hard work has gone into this project that will benefit the community and the region for years to come. Congratulations and thanks for allowing me to help celebrate.
