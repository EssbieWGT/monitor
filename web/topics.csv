We owe a great debt of gratitude to our military and their families who give so much to protect our nation. Among the many challenges that military families face, one of the greatest is that spouses working in fields requiring occupational licenses suffer huge setbacks to their careers. That is why I introduced the Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act.

This bill would simply ensure that when servicemembers are relocated on military orders, their spouses can receive reciprocity for professional licenses across state lines. If you, your spouse, a family member, or friend are experiencing the burden of new licensing requirements due to a military change of station order and would benefit from this change, I would be grateful to hear your story. Feel free to share your story to further raise attention, and use the hashtag #SupportMilitarySpouses.

Nationwide, employers can‚Äôt fill open jobs because the government incentivizes Americans to stay home instead of working.

We began our trip in the U.A.E., which will be the site of the Dubai World Expo. In a sign for a more hopeful world, they are hosting pavilions from friends and foes alike. While there, we visited our troops at Al Dhafra Air Base to thank them for their service. They not only play a vital security role in the region, but will be facilitating the safe withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Additionally, we met with U.A.E. leadership to exchange views and discuss our security partnership and ways to expand trade and investment. We also expressed mutual support for the Abraham Accords and the removal of U.A.E. forces from Yemen and noted the positive role they could play in resuming the JCPOA and reducing regional conflict.

Following our visit to the U.A.E., we traveled to Sudan. The U.S. has a key role to play in supporting Sudan‚Äôs journey from dictatorship toward democracy. The ousting of Dictator Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir in the peaceful revolution about two years ago brings fresh hope, and the U.S. should be a full partner with the Sudanese people as they seek a better future. The new Prime Minister, Cabinet, and Sovereign Council are working diligently to move from authoritarian rule to rule of law and to separation of religion and state. It‚Äôs important that the Sudanese Armed Forces be placed under a single command and that they proceed as planned to full civilian control of the government.

Sudan is now home to over 3.6 million refugees and displaced people as a result of years of conflicts. Most recently, there has been an influx of over 60,000 refugees fleeing the conflict in Ethiopia. We visited the Um Rakuba refugee camp to listen to the plight of people fleeing the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. I‚Äôm grateful to USAID - US Agency for International Development, the World Food Programme, and the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency for their humanitarian efforts there. The Biden Administration is doing everything it can to end the fighting in Ethiopia and resolve regional disputes.

I want to thank all of the U.S. Embassy personnel in Sudan and the U.A.E. and other posts around the world for the work they do ‚Äì often at great personal risk and sacrifice ‚Äì to serve our country. I'm proud to be the Co-Chair of the Foreign Service Caucus.

I authored a provision in the transportation appropriations bill in 2016 to designate the Future I-57 route.

Business owners, civic leaders and travelers all understand the importance of connecting Northeast and Central Arkansas to this major interstate because it creates economic growth and development opportunities and allows for increased ease of movement. I am pleased to have been updated on the latest developments with the effort to plan and complete the construction of an interstate-quality highway and bring I-57 from the Missouri border all the way to North Little Rock. I look forward to further helping make this vision a reality.

Public Service Recognition Week gives VA a chance to recognize those in our workforce that share time and talents to make their communities better. One such employee at the Topeka VA Medical Center is Mr. Mike Brooks, retired Army veteran with Environmental Management Services. Mike volunteers his time most weekdays at the Deer Creek Community After School program--helping disadvantaged children with homework, lessons, meals and encouragement. The children benefit by seeing a positive role model and learning that they can excel in school, sports and life by their own efforts.
