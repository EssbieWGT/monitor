2986,Thomas Massie,House,Republican,KY,4,2021-06-11 14:13:00.000000,"In case you missed it, I was Tammy Bruce's guest on Fox News Primetime last night. We discussed the recently released study out of the Cleveland Clinic that shows that those who have previously recovered from COVID-19 show no additional benefit from receiving the vaccine.

In December, I told the Washington DC CDC Director that the Pfizer trial data showed no benefit associated with taking the vaccine for those who have already recovered from a prior COVID-19 infection. The CDC looked at what I presented and admitted that my conclusion was right, but they took no action to correct their misrepresentation of the data to the public. As a result, the CDC has been misleading the public for over six months regarding the vaccine's efficacy for those with prior infection. The CDC's ongoing misrepresentations about vaccine efficacy are scandalous, to say the least.

I'm not anti-vaccine, and I'm not suggesting that one should go get COVID-19 instead of taking the vaccine, but the results of the Cleveland Clinic study further support what I have been saying for months, and what the Moderna and Pfizer trials showed. Not only does this new study show that there is no reason to take the vaccine if you have already recovered from the virus, but it also shows that natural immunity gained from exposure to COVID-19 lasts at least ten months.

Understanding how long natural immunity lasts is crucial to determining when the nation will reach herd immunity.

I certainly received my fair share of threats ‚Äî hundreds of tweets, attacks during meetings with heads of state, and more. This from a president who believed that the Department of Justice could and should be weaponized for his personal and political purposes.

This week, I learned Trump‚Äôs DOJ sought records from Apple about me, a House colleague, staff, family members of some of those affected, even a minor. They also sought a gag order to prevent us from finding out.

The politicization of the Department of Justice and the attacks on the rule of law were among Trump‚Äôs most dangerous assaults on our democracy. And while this matter has now been closed, it is yet another example of Trump's corrupt weaponization of justice ‚Äì and how much he imperiled our democracy.

We need a full accounting of the Trump DOJ‚Äôs abuse of power targeting Congress, the press, and his perceived political enemies. And it must be viewed in the context of his systemic politicization of the Department and its mission, and other flagrant abuses.

An Inspector General investigation is a step in the right direction, but it must be only the start. The full range of the misconduct must be examined, including former Attorney General Barr‚Äôs efforts to protect those who lied to cover up, and to go after Trump‚Äôs enemies.

After a hellish 1,000 mile journey to capture from the Japanese a critical airfield in Myitkyina, Burma on May 17, his battalion was tasked with holding the airfield and taking part in the siege of Myitkyina. James was reported to have been killed during fighting in early July of 1944, but his remains were not identified until just this year through DNA testing.

James and all of the Marauders gained a well-earned reputation for hard fighting and tenacity. 3,000 men volunteered for this mission, but when the airfield was finally reached, only around 200 men were capable of combat. In 2020, the Marauders were justly awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for their extraordinary efforts and sacrifices in the ‚Äúforgotten theater‚Äù of World War II.

Last year, she rammed a completely partisan infrastructure bill down our throats. Two out of every five dollars in that bill would have gone towards meeting Green New Deal mandates. Predictably, it went nowhere.

Now, instead of coming to the table to get a real bipartisan bill done, she decided to make her partisan bill even more partisan. Now, HALF of her infrastructure bill goes towards addressing progressive Green New Deal priorities. That‚Äôs insanity.

We tried everything we could to work on a real bill, but at every turn, they shut us down. So yesterday, we decided we‚Äôd try to fix at least some of the many GLARING problems in Pelosi‚Äôs ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù plan.

We started simple. Surely, we can all agree that transportation dollars should be spent on infrastructure, not art and landscaping.

Apparently, that was too much to ask because the majority voted down our common-sense amendment to exclude art from being eligible for transportation funding. Next, we tried to get some bipartisan regulatory reform done. After all, fixing the federal review process would close the gap between the liberal bill and my proposal, the STARTER Act 2.0.

Yet, they voted down that common-sense amendment too. With the majority clearly not interested in working together to improve their deeply flawed bill, we thought we‚Äôd find something that every American can agree on‚Äîthat federal transportation dollars shouldn‚Äôt be used to bail out cities that defund the police. After all, we all back the blue, right?

Again, the majority refused to listen to reason.

We should be working together to FIX legislation. No bill is perfect when it‚Äôs introduced. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a Republican bill or a Democrat bill. It‚Äôs going to have things that need fixing. This bill just happened to have a lot more problems than most.

2682,Bill Johnson,House,Republican,OH,6,2021-06-13 11:36:14.268566,"This week in my personal devotion time, I was reminded of both some important American history and an important message from God‚Äôs word.

During the summer of 1787, at the height of the efforts to write our constitution, it seemed the constitutional convention was at an impasse. There were serious doubts as to whether or not our founders would succeed. It was Benjamin Franklin who broke the deadlock. Upon being recognized on the floor of the convention, he said these immortal words‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI have lived long, Sir. And the longer I live and the more I see, the more convincing proof I see of this truth, that God deals in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow can‚Äôt fall from the sky without his notice, how do we think it probable that an empire can rise without his aid.‚Äù He then immediately called the convention to pray‚Ä¶to God, the Creator, the one who they had declared in the Declaration of Independence had created all men equal and endowed all men with those unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

I believe Benjamin Franklin and most, if not all, of our founders, understood what God‚Äôs word had told them‚Ä¶and we would be wise to remember this profound truth today.

Psalm 127: 1-2 ‚Äì ‚ÄúUnless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain. In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat‚Äîfor he grants sleep to those he loves.‚Äù

America was founded upon the principle that God is the grantor of our rights and freedoms‚Ä¶not man or government. America faces many challenges today because with the digital world and advances in technology the reach of those who would do our country harm ‚Äì both internally and externally ‚Äì has increased dramatically over the last 50 years. And to face and address those challenges and secure our freedoms and liberties, we would be wise to heed the words of the Psalmist and return to following God‚Äôs plan for our country.

President Joe Biden has proposed changes to the tax code, including increasing capital gains tax rates, increasing taxes on appreciated assets like farmland and limiting the use of like-kind exchanges. The next generation of family farmers will face devastating consequences if the president has his way, as his proposed changes put the future of nearly 2 million family-owned farm operations at risk.

These changes will impose a massive tax burden on farmers and ranchers, one that is likely to result in further consolidation in the agriculture sector as only the wealthiest of Americans would be able to afford to own pieces of America‚Äôs heartland, fertile valleys and forests.

The family farms that color the landscape of rural America are the true building block for a better future. We need to work toward a tax code that encourages their longevity, not one that puts their future in jeopardy.

As Senate Ag Committee Republicans leader, I'm championing our farmers, ranchers and agriculture industry against pressure to tax them out of business. Read my full Op-Ed for Fox News making the case that our family farms and ranches can't afford and shouldn't be forced to foot the bill for the president's spending spree:

This is another misguided decision that ignores the interests of Alaska working families and reasonable access to our lands, and instead sells out Alaska to the agenda of extreme environmental groups who have no interest in promoting economic opportunities in our state.

I raised the importance of this issue in my meeting with Secretary Vilsack during his confirmation process, and I am deeply disappointed that neither he nor anyone in his agency reached out to us before announcing this unilateral decision. Every governor and congressional representative from Alaska‚ÄîDemocrat and Republican‚Äîhas supported repealing the Roadless Rule for the last 25 years. The Biden administration‚Äôs announcement is an unacceptable whipsaw in federal policy just months after an exhaustively-reviewed final rule was issued by the Trump administration that struck the right balance between conserving the lands we cherish and fostering opportunities for hard-working Alaskans. The Biden administration needs to recognize that Alaskans in Southeast‚Äîlike any Americans‚Äîhave a right to connect their communities, sustain local economies, build renewable energy projects, and responsibly harvest resources, all of which is imperiled by a return to this unnecessary and overly-burdensome regulation.

The nature of the published information suggests it came directly from the IRS, constituting a serious breach of privacy and criminal violation of tax law. Further, this privacy breach comes at a time when the Administration is proposing to increase the amount of data collected by the IRS from checking, savings, and other accounts of almost every taxpayer. This circumstance demonstrates why Americans should be very concerned about giving the IRS direct access to that financial data. The American people deserve a thorough, independent investigation that uncovers how and why confidential information is apparently being leaked or obtained from the IRS, to find those responsible, and to criminally prosecute where warranted.

In Southeast Alaska, where the Tongass makes up the vast majority of the land base, the one-size-fits-all Roadless Rule has restricted access needed for tourism, recreation, timber, mining, transportation, and the development of renewable energy. Any action to repeal the final rule and reimpose the Roadless Rule will cost jobs, diminish income, keep energy prices high, and cripple the ability of the communities in the region to develop a sustainable, year-round economy. Alaskans believe the Roadless Rule is burdensome, unnecessary and since its inception have called for the Tongass to be exempt from it. The Trump administration, through the Forest Service and USDA, put considerable work and effort into the final rule and now the Biden administration is literally throwing it all away. We need to end this ‚Äúyo-yo effect‚Äù as the lives of Alaskans who live and work in the Tongass are upended every time we have a new President. This has to end. I will be using every tool at my disposal to fight back on the administration‚Äôs latest action. It‚Äôs time we move forward, utilizing the Tongass land management plan and all the other applicable environmental laws to guide new projects and activities and provide long overdue regulatory certainty to the region.

This tragedy occurred in the middle of Pride Month, a time that should be full of celebration for this community, which reminds us all of the work that remains for building tolerance and acceptance in our society. We must not forget the names and stories of those who were killed simply for expressing themselves and their identity freely.

It is our duty to honor the memories of those that were killed by gun violence by taking action to make sure life is not so senselessly lost again. Part of our responsibility is to pass meaningful gun violence prevention measures so that weapons of war and high-capacity magazines can‚Äôt be used to maximize killings, and that a person considered a threat to himself and others by many around him can‚Äôt access these lethal weapons.

There have been too many tragedies like this one, fueled by fear of those who look, believe, or love differently than us. Hate cannot and will not win. Together, we stand with the LGBTQ community for equality and for love.

See for yourself.

We've posted a few of these videos this week to highlight what is going on. I recently visited the southern border to assess the border crisis in Texas and New Mexico.

We need border security and to fix our broken immigration system. Protecting our borders is essential to our national security. A secure border will help prevent illegal crossings, terrorist attacks, and the unlawful trafficking of persons and drugs.

That said, there's no silver bullet solution to border security. In some cases, physical structures such as walls and fencing will secure our border. In other areas, enhanced surveillance, increased border patrols, and other measures will be required. To genuinely secure our border, we must constantly adapt our tactics.

Save the Sound has released its annual report on water quality at more than 200 Long Island Sound beaches across New York and Connecticut. Of the top 10 in New York, four are in #NY03!

We have made incredible strides over the last 20 years but we cannot let our guard down. We must continue to reduce nitrogen runoff and improve stormwater management and sewage infrastructure. Since arriving in Congress in 2017, I have worked to increase federal funding to clean up the Long Island Sound by more than 500 percent.

Working together with local, town, county, and state officials as well as local environmental groups, we can preserve, protect, and improve the Sound for generations to come.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin last week announced that another provision I was able to include as a member of the Armed Services Committee‚Äîthe Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies‚Äîwill come to fruition. Alaska is the reason that the United States is an Arctic nation, which is why we are fighting for the center to be based in our state. This would be instrumental in cultivating the Arctic policy expertise that is desperately needed in the Department of Defense. In order to address the rise of great power competition in the Arctic, the Ted Stevens Center will serve as a new focal point for strategic thinking as it combines Alaska‚Äôs extensive reserve of Arctic expertise with the best and brightest minds from around the world. I want to thank Secretary Austin for his focus on this critically-important geostrategic area of the world, Senator Murkowski for initially conceiving of the idea and working to appropriate funds for the center, and Congressman Young for carrying it across the finish line in the House.

I'm excited that next week, the House will vote on the PUGET SOS Act - legislation I introduced with Congresswoman Marilyn Strickland to ensure the federal government steps-up to be the partner that state, tribal, and local entities need to save our Sound ‚Äì and to assist regional efforts to restore salmon and orca populations, ensure future generations can dig for clams, and uphold tribal treaty rights.

We should not place such an expensive and unnecessary burden on them to access lands that they are owed.

2962,Jeff Fortenberry,House,Republican,NE,1,2021-06-11 14:59:00.000000,"FORT REPORT: Preventing the Unthinkable

When I was growing up, the prospect of nuclear war and nuclear confrontation were an ongoing consideration in society and among U.S. policymakers, particularly at the height of the Cold War. Movies, TV shows, and the nightly news regularly and ominously referenced the nuclear threat.

When the Berlin Wall fell and we went through a transition period with the Russians, the probability of a nuclear exchange, we believed, had significantly diminished. We moved on and hoped for normalized relations. Russia has not. Now China wants in. They have actively engaged in modernizing their nuclear weapons and systems.

Here‚Äôs our challenge: some of our technology is ‚Äúvintage.‚Äù In a lighter symbolic moment, as I was visiting with some of our military personnel on a very advanced platform, I saw a roll of duct tape sitting there. I looked at the officer and said, ‚ÄúEven here? The handyman‚Äôs secret weapon?‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúEven here.‚Äù

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. Our nation is safe. We have extraordinary personnel and systems, particularly deployed at our nation‚Äôs nuclear nerve center, U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), where we have a new facility and outstanding leadership that is on top of this situation, right here in Nebraska. You will soon hear more about the NC3 Enterprise Center (NEC), a separate organization from STRATCOM, which is the de facto ‚Äúconductor of a large orchestra‚Äù across hundreds of systems, the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy, and invaluable private sector and academic contributors, to ensure our nation‚Äôs strategic nuclear deterrence. When these officials collectively and individually tell me that there is a clear need to advance our nuclear command, control, and communications infrastructure, I believe them.

It‚Äôs important to remember that the purpose of nuclear weapons is to prevent their use through robust deterrence. To achieve that goal, we need the highest technical capability, combined with the latest and best communications equipment, to ensure the rapid flow of precise information to key decision-makers at any time, under any circumstance, anywhere in the world, so they are never left wondering whether a nuclear event is a mistake, and are given enough time and flexibility to respond in case it is not.

In Congress, I co-chair the bipartisan Congressional Nuclear Security Working Group, which is committed to keeping us safe, smartly and strategically. Our work is to lower the probability as close to zero as possible for any mistake in the nuclear enterprise. We are in regular dialogue with our military command structure on these points.

It‚Äôs good that Nebraska is leading the way.

I am very grateful for the advocacy of Juneau's Chamber on behalf of our small businesses, particularly those in our tourism economy. It hasn't been an easy year. The loss of the 2020 cruise season was devastating for these businesses. The threat of losing a second consecutive season brought a sense of anxiety and dread to far too many families.

Working with the Administration and colleagues on both sides, I am very proud that my bill, the Alaska Tourism Restoration Act (H.R. 1318), was passed and signed into law, allowing a good portion of the 2021 cruise season to commence. Tickets are on sale, and soon Juneau will once again be welcoming visitors from around the world.

I want to thank everyone who attended for their excellent questions. They also presented me with a very special plaque to commemorate my work on the cruise bill, and I look forward to displaying it in my office.

Additionally, following through with this rule would have placed hundreds of thousands of children at risk of losing free school meals and would have also jeopardized food access and local economies by costing grocery retailers an estimated three billion dollars in sales.

Broad-based categorical-eligibility allows hard-working Americans trying to escape the cycle of poverty to save money while receiving SNAP, offering a path to financial sustainability. We should be working to remove barriers to hunger reduction and upward mobility, not creating them.

This is a very sad day for the State of Alaska. Rolling back the Roadless Rule exemption is not only a devastating attack on our state's economy, but also shows a terrible disregard for Alaskans' right to govern themselves.

Our fellow Americans across the Lower 48 enjoy the opportunity to live, work, and prosper in their communities. They can do this in large part because of the energy and economic opportunity available to them. Alaskans in the region are only asking for the same opportunities to thrive. Repealing the Roadless Rule exemption pulls out the rug from beneath families in Southeast and puts affordable energy, fully funded schools, and quality health care further out of reach.

I want to say I am surprised by this Administration's decision, but it is entirely predictable given that Secretary Vilsack's office lies over 4,000 miles away from the Tongass.

To the Secretary, I say this: Come to Alaska; visit Southeast. Before making a decision on behalf of my constituents, experience the tremendous social and economic burden the Roadless Rule has imposed on them up close.

The COVID-19 pandemic has already harmed our economy, and today's decision is yet another nail in the coffin for economic opportunity in Southeast. I call on President Biden to reverse this decision so that future Administrations stop using the Roadless Rule as a political football; the very livelihoods of families hang in the balance.

After learning about the pattern of over 50 infant deaths, the Oversight Committee launched an investigation in 2019 and it was recently concluded that there are grave flaws in our U.S. consumer product safety system. The vast majority of products on the market are only governed by voluntary standards which are set by the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) International. However, the ASTM committees include employees who work for manufacturers, such as Fisher-Price, and who can directly influence the standards that will apply to their company‚Äôs products. This conflict of interest can weaken safety standards and put consumers in danger. We must ensure safe and reliable safety standards that the American people can trust.
