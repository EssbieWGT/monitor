It is nothing more than a naked political move by the Biden administration to pay off its extreme environmental allies. The law is clear: Congress mandated the leasing program in the 1002 Area and required two lease sales within seven years. BLM Alaska’s staff worked tirelessly to develop a comprehensive and durable EIS and leasing program in order to issue the first leases in 2021. The announcement today disregards that fact-based scientific work, as well as the property interests of those who hold these leases, including the State of Alaska. It also utterly disregards BLM scientists and Alaskans from across the political spectrum—Republicans, Democrats, Independents, unions, working families, as well the Alaska Natives who live closest to the area and who fought for decades for the right to allow for the responsible development of the 1002 Area of ANWR in order to strengthen our communities and build a better life for our children.

Over nearly three decades of service in the Navy and at NASA, Chris, a Navy SEAL, was deployed four times, received the bronze star, and participated in three space flights. When he joined Dr. Jessica Meir on the International Space Station last year, it marked the first time in history that two Mainers were in space simultaneously. I was delighted to participate in a Q&A with them on NASA TV so that students and educators could hear about their experiences.

Thank you, Chris, for inspiring countless young Mainers to reach for the stars, achieve their dreams, and serve their country.

In Tulsa, I joined Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester in laying a wreath at the dedication of the prayer wall at the Vernon AME Church in Greenwood in memory of those lost. We saw the basement of the church—where survivors gathered to begin the process of rebuilding Greenwood and reclaiming their lives. It was powerfully moving to see marks of the fire and to hear from members of the congregation about their work and challenges in the city today.

Our pilgrimage concluded with a candlelight vigil in the rain where we joined hundreds of people to stand along Greenwood Avenue – in memory of those whose lives and homes and businesses were destroyed a century ago.

I hope we can all take time to reflect on this history today.

1423,Lisa Murkowski,Senate,Republican,AK,,2021-06-02 02:51:40,"Today the Department of the Interior announced it will suspend all oil and gas leases for portions of the non-wilderness Coastal Plain (1002 Area) of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), pending the outcome of another environmental review. The Biden administration’s actions are not unexpected but are outrageous nonetheless. Suspending leases in Alaska’s 1002 Area is in direct conflict with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, through which Congress mandates an oil and gas leasing program be established on the non-wilderness Coastal Plain, and ordered at least two lease sales by 2024. In addition, The Act specifically states that the purpose of the 1002 area of ANWR is oil and gas development. The oil and gas leasing program established by the Trump Administration meets the legal mandates required by Congress including imposing a framework with a range of environmental safeguards that are successfully guiding production elsewhere in northern Alaska. This action serves no purpose other than to obstruct Alaska’s economy and put our energy security at great risk. Alaskans are committed to developing our resources responsibly and have demonstrated our ability to do so safely to the world. For more information, follow the link below.
