Our bill invests $1.25 trillion over the next decade for federal agencies and state, local and tribal governments to buy clean energy products, electrify transit, and retrofit buildings to be energy efficient. It includes strong labor protections and help for frontline communities. And it also invests $250 billion over the next decade to create a competitive grant program to help US companies make clean energy products right here at home and bolster our clean energy sector.

The government spends tons of money on everything from light bulbs and printer cartridges to vehicles and office buildings. Our Buy Green Act is a big, bold way to spend that money for good to fight the climate crisis and make America a world leader in green innovation.

NEW: In a new leaked video, dark money group Heritage Action brags to top donors about writing “model legislation” making it harder to vote in places like Georgia, Texas, Iowa, Florida, and Arizona.

We got the best practices to them. We helped draft the bills…Little fanfare. Honestly, nobody even noticed. My team looked at each other and we’re like, ‘It can’t be that easy.’”

1644,Dianne Feinstein,Senate,Democrat,CA,,2021-05-27 11:22:49,"Western wildfires are becoming more frequent, more destructive and more deadly. This is happening because higher temperatures caused by climate change are leading to increased drought, more insect and disease damage and changing weather patterns.

We must do more to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire and prepare for the fires we know are ahead of us. This bill uses a three-pronged approach: large-scale forest restoration projects, hardening critical infrastructure and increased training of key personnel.

This bill complements other priorities like stabilizing the federal wildland firefighting workforce and retrofitting air tankers. We need a whole-of-government effort to battle catastrophic wildfire and address climate change. This bill moves us in that direction.

However, the reported redeployment of the Reagan from Indo-Pacific Command to Central Command underscores that we are asking the military to do too much with too little. There are no other carriers available, and the Ford remains far behind schedule. The Secretary of Defense should not have to choose between providing force protection and keeping an aircraft carrier in the priority theater.

As Americans pause to reflect on the sacrifice of service members during the Memorial Day weekend, the Biden administration is expected to deliver its budget proposal for fiscal year 2022 — a budget that cuts funding for our military. This sends a terrible signal to Beijing, who will also take note of this aircraft carrier leaving the Western Pacific.

This redeployment also highlights the fundamentally flawed approach of unconditional withdrawal from Afghanistan. While no one wants to keep American troops in Afghanistan forever, leaving without a plan will certainly require continued deployment of warships and aircraft as the military attempts to conduct a similar counter-terror mission from afar. Every day, it becomes clearer that the American military requires much more funding to carry out U.S. strategy.

If Joe Biden gives away the intellectual property for the vaccines and then compels companies to teach people how to reverse engineer their processes and trade secrets, he will cause all of our drug manufacturing to go overseas. Currently, we make vaccines in places like Kansas and Michigan.

Regarding the eviction moratorium, the CDC is telling renters, ""you don't have to pay your rent."" But if you're a property owner, try not paying your property taxes this year or last year and see what happens. They will take your property away and sell it at an auction.

Willow will create thousands of direct and indirect jobs in Alaska, and provide opportunities and billions of dollars in revenues for our state and indigenous communities on the North Slope. It will produce American energy with the highest environmental standards at a time when we’re importing far too much from our adversaries, like Russia.

I appreciate the President and Secretary Haaland for listening to us and defending this once-in-a-generation energy development that will unlock many more opportunities for our state and our country. I also want to commend the numerous Alaskans and Alaska Native leaders—especially those who live within NPR-A and on the North Slope—for weighing in with the secretary and making the case for Willow. While this is excellent news for our state, I remain deeply concerned about some of the administration’s remaining policies that are still targeting Alaska and our workers, but today’s news on Willow is very positive for Alaska, good-paying jobs for working families, and our economy.

1648,Lisa Murkowski,Senate,Republican,AK,,2021-05-27 11:06:54,"Alaska’s relationship with the Biden administration got off to a rough start after the President’s sweep of a pen called for reviews – and potential halts - to a number of responsible resource development projects. I’ve been working from the get-go to educate the new administration on why the Willow project is so important to Alaska’s economy, the communities on the North Slope, and the thousands of people who are employed in the region. I am pleased to share that the Department of the Interior has filed a brief in support of Willow and has committed to supporting the project moving forward. Through their careful review, the administration reached the same conclusion that we have always known, which is that the Willow project went through a rigorous, comprehensive permitting process and can move forward because it is being held to the highest environmental and labor standards in the world.

As a senior member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and former Committee chair, I have been aggressive in my advocacy for the Willow project. I brought the significance of the project to President Biden’s attention and many other senior White House officials on the first day of the new administration. During her confirmation process, I pressed now Interior Secretary Haaland to defend the Record of Decisions for the Willow project now being litigated in courts. I submitted multiple letters of support for the record from Alaskans and exhausted all avenues to send a clear message: this project has gone through an extraordinarily extensive process and should be allowed to proceed. The process goes all the way back to when the leases were acquired under the Clinton administration. The NEPA analysis was conducted using the Obama administration 2013 Integrated Activity Plan, which contains over 270 mitigation requirements. And a two-year long EIS process began in 2018 which included over 100 meetings with stakeholders on the North Slope and multiple public comment periods, resulting in a robust 2,600 page final EIS. The process across multiple administrations has been more than thorough. It’s time to move this project forward.

At a time when Russia is providing more barrels of crude oil to the United States per day than Alaska, the Alaska Delegation has continued to stress to this administration the importance of this new development project located within the National Petroleum Reserve – Alaska. The Willow project would not only provide a valuable resource, but could also create around 2,000 high paying jobs in Alaska and support $2.3 billion dollars in revenue for the state—a boost to the economy at a time when we need it most. I’m glad the Interior Department has listened to our advice and will now defend the litigation and allow the permit to proceed. I urge Interior to show Alaskans that their words and actions align by taking the Willow project off their “pause and review” list once and for all.

1651,Benjamin L. Cardin,Senate,Democrat,MD,,2021-05-27 10:49:54,"Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, celebrated each June, offers all Americans the opportunity to recognize and to appreciate the important role of this community in our nation –- both throughout history and today. It is more important than ever that we all take advantage of it.

Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have played a vital role in our nation’s battle with COVID-19. Serving as frontline workers, first responders and emergency personnel, they have provided life-saving and critical care to hundreds of thousands of people during unprecedented times.

The approximately 555,200 Asian-owned businesses in the U.S. represent approximately 1 in 10 businesses in the nation. As the Chair of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, I know the importance of each of these enterprises to our national economy and to the local communities they serve. I also know the serious challenges that all small business owners, but particularly minority-owned businesses, have faced since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yet over the last year and a half, we’ve seen an alarming and dangerous rise in prejudicial treatment and racially motivated hate crimes and attacks. According to a recent report, there were nearly 3,800 reported cases of anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID–19 between March 2020 and February 2021. Dangerous rhetoric such as calling COVID-19 the “Chinese Virus” and “Wuhan Flu” jeopardizes the safety and well-being of millions of Asian-Americans.

It is time we stand up and protect our fellow neighbors, friends, co-workers and loved ones. We need an all-hands-on-deck approach to combat anti-Asian bias, prejudice, discrimination, hate crimes and violence. Congress overwhelmingly passed S. 937, the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act, which Senators Hirono and Duckworth introduced. This legislation serves as a pledge to our Asian-American community that we, as the United States of America, stand in solidarity with you and will not tolerate violations of your civil rights.

STRIDE Community Health Center
Yesterday at 12:01 AM ·

Last week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that Community Health Centers had officially administered over 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. They also released another monumental statistic: 61% of those 10 million vaccine doses were administered to racial and ethnic minorities.

The continuation of this massive vaccination effort would not be possible without funding from The American Recovery Act, which Congress passed thanks to the efforts of passionate supporters like Colorado Congressman Ed Perlmutter.

Congressman Perlmutter paid a visit to STRIDE's west side vaccination site this morning, where we were able to thank him in person for his advocacy, and show him the impact it has had on the community we serve.

I voted for TWO House-passed gun reform bills (universal background checks & closing the Charleston loophole) and it’s past time for the Senate to vote!
Senator Bob Casey & I have introduced our Resources for Victims of Gun Violence Act, which helps the survivors and families who have been impacted by gun violence. You can read more about the bill here: https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-evans-push-to-support-victims-of-gun-violence-
In Philly, community organizations like Philly Truce have attempted to quell the violence, but help is needed at the federal level – the Senate must ACT!
https://www.philasun.com/local/philly-truce-day-defies-weather-and-enters-the-citys-history-books/
Policing reform like the House-passed George Floyd Justice In Policing Act that I voted for is also essential to increase community trust in police & reduce gun violence – it’s time for the Senate to agree to a strong bill that President Biden can sign!

It is unfortunate and disappointing that the Biden Administration is essentially taking guidance from the former Trump Administration on a critical environmental issue that could have decades-long impacts on one of our nation's most pristine areas of wilderness. There is absolutely no sound reason for the Biden Administration to continue defending the prior efforts of the Trump Administration to advance an aggressive oil and gas development agenda that sells out our environment for short-term profits.

The Trump-era process that approved this project turned a blind eye to the public health, shut out the voice of Alaskan Natives and ignored the environmental, subsistence, and climate impacts these projects will have. If the Biden Administration continues to see value in this project than it must start the approval process over. Anything short of a full restart of the process would be irresponsible.

The Small Business Association is now accepting applications for federal grant money that will set up support networks nationwide — known as “Community Navigators” — to reach out to the small businesses and provide SBA support in our community, with a priority focus on those owned by “socially and economically disadvantaged” businesses, as well as women and veterans.

Community Navigators will aid so-called underserved and underrepresented communities.

Through the Community Navigator Pilot Program, U.S. Small Business Administration will engage with states, local governments, SBA resource partners, and other organizations in targeted outreach to small businesses. Individual grants will be awarded. This is a $100 million investment which is part of the #AmericanRescuePlan. https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance/community-navigators

Starting today, May 27, eligible entities can apply here: https://www.sba.gov/partners/counselors/community-navigator-pilot-program. Please take advantage of this opportunity, which will be available through July 12.

Community Navigators will include: State governments, county governments, city or township governments, federally recognized Native American tribal governments, Native American tribal organizations, nonprofits having a 501(c) (3) status with the IRS, economic development organizations, SBA resource partners, Small Business Development Centers, Women’s Business Centers, Veterans Business Outreach Centers, SCORE Mentors (“Counselors to America’s Small Businesses”), Community Development Financial Institutions, and nonprofit colleges and universities.",0,0,5,0,RepKweisiMfume,Facebook,https://facebook.com/RepKweisiMfume/posts/302240684957250,https://scontent-iad3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/191207661_302239764957342_4889569248193897688_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=o2cK98Z1WCUAX_d35J_&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.xx&tp=14&oh=226d7eff78a04785c746d7e52cc26174&oe=60D7693F,,grants help small businesses community apply herethe small business association accepting applications federal grant money set support networks nationwide known community navigators reach small businesses provide sba support community priority focus owned socially economically disadvantaged businesses well women veteranscommunity navigators aid socalled underserved underrepresented communitiesthrough community navigator pilot program us small business administration engage states local governments sba resource partners organizations targeted outreach small businesses individual grants awarded million investment part americanrescueplan starting today may eligible entities apply please take advantage opportunity available july 12community navigators include state governments county governments city township governments federally recognized native american tribal governments native american tribal organizations nonprofits 501c status irs economic development organizations sba resource partners small business development centers womens business centers veterans business outreach centers score mentors counselors americas small businesses community development financial institutions nonprofit colleges universities,"['grants', 'help', 'small', 'businesses', 'community', 'apply', 'herethe', 'small', 'business', 'association', 'accepting', 'applications', 'federal', 'grant', 'money', 'set', 'support', 'networks', 'nationwide', 'known', 'community', 'navigators', 'reach', 'small', 'businesses', 'provide', 'sba', 'support', 'community', 'priority', 'focus', 'owned', 'socially', 'economically', 'disadvantaged', 'businesses', 'well', 'women', 'veteranscommunity', 'navigators', 'aid', 'socalled', 'underserved', 'underrepresented', 'communitiesthrough', 'community', 'navigator', 'pilot', 'program', 'us', 'small', 'business', 'administration', 'engage', 'states', 'local', 'governments', 'sba', 'resource', 'partners', 'organizations', 'targeted', 'outreach', 'small', 'businesses', 'individual', 'grants', 'awarded', 'million', 'investment', 'part', 'americanrescueplan', 'starting', 'today', 'may', 'eligible', 'entities', 'apply', 'please', 'take', 'advantage', 'opportunity', 'available', 'july', '12community', 'navigators', 'include', 'state', 'governments', 'county', 'governments', 'city', 'township', 'governments', 'federally', 'recognized', 'native', 'american', 'tribal', 'governments', 'native', 'american', 'tribal', 'organizations', 'nonprofits', '501c', 'status', 'irs', 'economic', 'development', 'organizations', 'sba', 'resource', 'partners', 'small', 'business', 'development', 'centers', 'womens', 'business', 'centers', 'veterans', 'business', 'outreach', 'centers', 'score', 'mentors', 'counselors', 'americas', 'small', 'businesses', 'community', 'development', 'financial', 'institutions', 'nonprofit', 'colleges', 'universities']",27,5,38145
