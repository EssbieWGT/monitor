This effort stands in stark contrast to the Biden administration’s shameful recent decisions to hurt these deserving Alaska heroes. It’s clear that the governor and his team are thinking creatively and proposing solutions to bring justice to Alaska Native veterans that has eluded them for decades.

Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s recent decision takes 28 million acres of federal land off the table for the veterans to choose from by imposing a two-year stay in publishing several previously-approved public land orders in Alaska. Secretary Haaland personally committed to me to help these Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans. The fact that the Department of the Interior recently put the interests of radical green environmental groups over the interests of these American Vietnam-era veterans and countless other Alaskans is shameful.

These Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans—deserving, selfless Americans who have sacrificed so much for their country—have already waited decades for land allotments and, tragically, some may not live to see them. These veterans have already waited far too long, which is why I welcome Governor Dunleavy’s proposal to provide flexibility by making state lands available.

o Allocated $15 billion in flexible grants to help the smallest, most severely impacted businesses persevere through the pandemic.

o Bolstered the Paycheck Protection Program with an additional $7.25 billion in funding to support small businesses and non-profits that were previously excluded, such as businesses owned by women, veterans, and minorities.

o Launched the Restaurant Revitalization Fund to provide $28 billion in relief to restaurants and other hard-hit food establishments — bars, bakeries, food stands, food trucks, caterers – to help businesses get grants to cover payroll, rent, utilities, and supplies.

More than 186,200 eligible businesses have applied for support through the new Restaurant Revitalization Fund in two days, illustrating the ongoing need for creative measures like those in the American Rescue Plan.
