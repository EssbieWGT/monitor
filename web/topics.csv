It was a pleasure to tour the facility, meet with the employees, and hear about the legislative agenda of the National Propane Gas Association and the Kentucky Propane Gas Association.

As a member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I was interested to hear how Arrick's Propane customers are increasingly using propane as an alternative fuel source for transportation needs. To underscore this point, Mr. Arrick showed me a van he customized that runs on both propane and gasoline.

Propane offers a number of economic and environmental benefits. In my off-the-grid home, the clothes dryer, cookstove, on-demand hot-water heater, and backup generator all run on this fuel. Until we see big improvements in battery technology, propane is the best complement to residential solar installations because it's domestically produced, easy to store, clean-burning, and has a high energy density. Arrick's Propane employees were pleased about the extent to which I use their preferred fuel source. They asked me to join the Congressional Propane Caucus, which I am happy to do since propane is a clean source of energy that we don't have to import from other countries!",56,17,601,0,RepThomasMassie,Facebook,https://facebook.com/RepThomasMassie/posts/4510330642324398,https://scontent-iad3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/196249276_4510359722321490_3151734920216861297_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8024bb&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=j_3aQfznRuAAX-BDyYE&_nc_oc=AQmK_BKJ_al8d5zBjXSPPjHkh-ayjPzbgOt5pbU_tZTA3Q8A8sQ0gPeQmcXz0YivhH0&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.xx&tp=14&oh=47e08428f842372e98c79f8c3429a2cb&oe=60E669AF,,recently opportunity visit arricks propane south portsmouth invitation owner ralph arrick pleasure tour facility meet employees hear legislative agenda national propane gas association kentucky propane gas associationas member house committee transportation infrastructure interested hear arricks propane customers increasingly using propane alternative fuel source transportation needs underscore point mr arrick showed van customized runs propane gasolinepropane offers number economic environmental benefits offthegrid home clothes dryer cookstove ondemand hotwater heater backup generator run fuel see big improvements battery technology propane best complement residential solar installations domestically produced easy store cleanburning high energy density arricks propane employees pleased extent use preferred fuel source asked join congressional propane caucus happy since propane clean source energy dont import countries,"['recently', 'opportunity', 'visit', 'arricks', 'propane', 'south', 'portsmouth', 'invitation', 'owner', 'ralph', 'arrick', 'pleasure', 'tour', 'facility', 'meet', 'employees', 'hear', 'legislative', 'agenda', 'national', 'propane', 'gas', 'association', 'kentucky', 'propane', 'gas', 'associationas', 'member', 'house', 'committee', 'transportation', 'infrastructure', 'interested', 'hear', 'arricks', 'propane', 'customers', 'increasingly', 'using', 'propane', 'alternative', 'fuel', 'source', 'transportation', 'needs', 'underscore', 'point', 'mr', 'arrick', 'showed', 'van', 'customized', 'runs', 'propane', 'gasolinepropane', 'offers', 'number', 'economic', 'environmental', 'benefits', 'offthegrid', 'home', 'clothes', 'dryer', 'cookstove', 'ondemand', 'hotwater', 'heater', 'backup', 'generator', 'run', 'fuel', 'see', 'big', 'improvements', 'battery', 'technology', 'propane', 'best', 'complement', 'residential', 'solar', 'installations', 'domestically', 'produced', 'easy', 'store', 'cleanburning', 'high', 'energy', 'density', 'arricks', 'propane', 'employees', 'pleased', 'extent', 'use', 'preferred', 'fuel', 'source', 'asked', 'join', 'congressional', 'propane', 'caucus', 'happy', 'since', 'propane', 'clean', 'source', 'energy', 'dont', 'import', 'countries']",27,674,70009

The problem, however, is that he was also privately running a similar operation over in China. He's accused of hiding this inconvenient fact from U.S. authorities. All this means that this guy was able to funnel our nation's intellectual property over to the Chinese government.

This happens all too frequently. There's essentially a free flow of sensitive and classified research funded by American taxpayers into the possession of our global competitors and adversaries. And communist China is one of the worst offenders.

That's why I recently introduced legislation on this front, which would require that visa sponsors notify the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) whenever a visa recipient participates in federally funded research. And it also gives DHS the ability to revoke that visa if the individual is considered to be a risk to homeland security, national security, or the research integrity of his/her sponsor.

We owe it to the brave men and women who responded that day to do everything we can to prevent an attack like this from ever happening again, and in every instance ensure that the Capitol Police have the training and equipment that they need.

In the time it took her to make her current trip to Guatemala and Mexico, hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants have entered our country as a result of President Biden’s weak immigration policies.

In April alone, 178,000 migrants were encountered by U.S. Border Patrol, the most in a single month since FY2000.

In my seven trips to the southwest border, I have never seen a worse situation than I did during my recent April visit. Drug smuggling, human trafficking, and weapon trafficking into the U.S. is increasing after Biden hastily revoked many of President Trump’s national security policies, like the “Remain in Mexico” policy and construction of the border wall, giving immigrants leeway to enter the U.S.

In February, cartels raked in over $14 million a day from human trafficking -- an urgent situation putting Americans in danger.

2242,John H. Rutherford,House,Republican,FL,4,2021-06-08 12:07:26.680151,"NOAA recently announced the 2021 South Atlantic red snapper season will be July 9 - 11th. You can find more information from NOAA on how to take advantage of this year's season at the link below.

I am again disappointed by this short season. Constituents tell me they see so many red snapper in our waters, you can almost walk on their backs. Yet, NOAA again only allows access to the fishery a few days a year. The short season highlights the need for NOAA to use better data.

That is why I secured $3.3 million for an independent study of the South Atlantic red snapper fishery, which is currently underway. This study uses innovative research techniques to better report data on the true fish stock, hopefully leading to longer seasons and more days on the water for our anglers in Northeast Florida.

If things continue at this disappointing rate, it will take an entire year to get our economy back to its pre-COVID performance.

Several things are at play here. For one, job creators are staring at potential huge tax hikes and more costly regulations as part of the Green New Deal initiatives of this White House. To a job creator, this means less potential for growth, which means there is no incentive to hire beyond what is absolutely necessary. Much higher energy costs and inflation eat into the bottom line as well. And to top it all off, many job creators can’t find enough workers to keep the same hours operationally as they were pre-COVID.

According to NFIB’s monthly jobs report, nearly half of small business owners are unable to fill job openings.

While military competition with China is serious on its own, China is a full-spectrum threat – and that requires a focused, coordinated response from the full U.S. federal government.

A big part of competing with China is getting our military posture in the Pacific right. Our witness, former Trump official Matt Pottinger, said that by expanding infrastructure west of the Intl Date Line, we complicate the Chinese Communist Party's military strategy and become a more formidable deterrent.

Dr. Sheena Greitens also emphasized China’s technology that enables it to surveil and oppress its citizens, including the Uyghurs and the people of Hong Kong. We need a robust, whole-of-government to stop the spread of Chinese surveillance technology around the world.

We need border security and to fix our broken immigration system. Protecting our borders is essential to our national security. A secure border will help prevent illegal crossings, terrorist attacks, and the unlawful trafficking of persons and drugs.

That said, there's no silver bullet solution to border security. In some cases, physical structures such as walls and fencing will secure our border. In other areas, enhanced surveillance, increased border patrols, and other measures will be required. To genuinely secure our border, we must constantly adapt our tactics.

Failure to enforce our laws and secure our borders creates a perverse incentive for people to come here illegally and can cause delays in the process for those who want to come here the right way.

Until then, they will suffer in silence and feel alone in their illness.”

These heartfelt words from a family who lost their child to suicide speak to the devastating reality of youth suicide and the urgent need to prioritize mental health resources as we recover and rebuild from COVID-19. We can and must do more.

Alarmingly, these dynamics greatly increase the risk of miscalculation and conflict.

As chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, I have studied this issue at length and worked with key personnel responsible for executing U.S. nuclear modernization efforts. This work has shown me that the risk for nuclear conflict is the greatest it has been in over three decades.

There are several commonsense changes we can make today to our nuclear modernization efforts to build upon the progress the Biden Administration has made and free up much-needed funds while staving off a costly and deadly nuclear arms race. As the chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, I intend to do everything in my power to chart a new course in our modernization efforts — one that brings us back to a policy of deterrence rather than one of dominance.

Climate-related events are devastating for global biodiversity and communities worldwide.

That’s why, as a member of the Oceans Caucus, I celebrate the reintroduction of Congressman Raul M. Grijalva’s Ocean-Based Climate Solutions Act, which I proudly support. This important legislation will integrate evidence-based approaches to protect our ocean and coastal communities, promote sustainable job opportunities, and support clean offshore energy while reducing the devastating impacts of the climate crisis. It will prioritize just and equitable climate solutions for communities of color, low-income communities, Tribal and Indigenous communities, and territories.

Furthermore, it’s crucial that the Biden Administration includes ocean-based climate solutions in its agenda and plans to fight climate change. The ocean plays a critical role in the climate equation.

2025,Ken Calvert,House,Republican,CA,42,2021-06-08 17:43:37.568107,"I’m pleased to see projects in the 42nd Congressional District are receiving a total of $20 million, on top of the federal formula funding that goes to our region, in the Fiscal Year 2022 surface transportation authorization bill that is set to be considered this week by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Riverside County residents know all too well how desperately we need to invest in transportation improvements to ease the congestion on our freeways and roads. I have worked closely with our local cities and county officials to identify important, eligible transportation projects that need resources to be completed.

There’s no silver bullet to solving our congestion problems, and no single project is the answer. However, I’m hopeful that by continuing to build projects like the Riverside County priorities included in the bill and bringing additional federal resources to our region we can make a positive impact. That’s also why I have broader concerns about some of the programs and priorities Democrats have included in this reauthorization. Far too many federal dollars are being spent on things that will not help us address congestion relief. I’m hopeful that significant changes can be made to the bill before it comes to the House floor for a vote.

The following Riverside County transportation projects were included in the bill after funding requests were submitted and advocated for by my office and local sponsors:

Interstate-15 Corridor Operations Project $3 million: The funding was requested by the Riverside County Transportation Commission to add a southbound auxiliary lane on I-15 between Cajalco Road and Weirick Road to address a major bottleneck and help relieve peak afternoon congestion. Organizations including the Greater Corona Traffic Alliance, the Western Riverside Council of Governments, the Greater Riverside Chamber of Commerce, the Temecula Valley Chamber of Commerce, and the Southern California Association of Governments submitted letters of support for the project.

Scott Road/Bundy Canyon Road Widening Project - $12 million: The funding was requested by the city of Menifee to widen the existing Scott Road/Bundy Canyon road connection between I-15 and I-215 from a two-lane road to a four-lane corridor. The project area links the cities of Wildomar, Menifee, Murrieta and unincorporated areas of Riverside County. According to the city of Menifee, in addition to reducing congestion, the improvement project will significantly improve driver safety and reduce accident fatality along this high traveled, multi-jurisdiction corridor. Organizations including the Southern California Association of Governments, the Menifee Valley Chamber of Commerce, Loma Linda University Medica Center – Murrieta, and the Western Riverside Council of Governments submitted letters of support for the project.

Temescal Canyon Road Widening Project - El Cerrito Segment - $5 million: The funding was requested by the Riverside County Transportation and Land Management Agency to widen Temescal Canyon Road from two to four lanes from north of El Cerrito Road to Tom Barnes Street and includes a 200-foot segment of widening north of Cajalco Road. This is the last remaining segment of Temescal Canyon Road that has not been widened to four lanes. According to a support letter from the city of Corona, “the project will enhance the quality of life in Temescal Valley and have a positive impact on the health and safety of residents, businesses, and visitors.” Organizations including “We Are Temescal Valley,” the Corona Chamber of Commerce, as well as multiple Temescal Valley residents submitted letters of support for the project.",9,1,16,0,70063393423,Facebook,https://facebook.com/70063393423/posts/10158287219318424,,,im pleased see projects 42nd congressional district receiving total million top federal formula

Aplaudo al Grupo de Trabajo de Reunificación Familiar por su esfuerzo por reunir a familias previamente separadas bajo la administración de Trump. Bajo ninguna circunstancia se debe separar a un niño de sus padres como una herramienta para aplicar la ley.

Our state has more coastline than the rest of the United States combined and, as a result, we see the devastating impacts of garbage in the oceans first hand.

My Save Our Seas 2.0 Act established a new Marine Debris Foundation that will support the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other entities in addressing this challenge. NOAA needs the expertise and insights that Alaskans have to make the Marine Debris Foundation a success, which is why I’m strongly encouraging all of those who are interested and qualified to apply. Ultimately, there is a strong case to be made for this foundation to be based in Alaska, but first we need to ensure the perspectives of Alaskans are well represented on the board.

2297,Don Young,House,Republican,AK,0,2021-06-08 10:35:16.277910,"🚨BREAKING🚨

Today, I introduced a bipartisan bill to PERMANENTLY reauthorize the Highly Rural Veterans Transportation Program, which is crucially important to veterans across our vast state. Through it, highly rural veterans can receive NO-COST rides to VA or VA-authorized health care facilities.

I am committed to ensuring that the rural veterans who put their lives on the line for us are not forgotten. Since its creation, I have always supported reauthorizing the Highly Rural Veterans Program. Too often, we as a Congress have engaged more in partisan bickering than legislating. A program as important as this one should not be used as a negotiating tool or to gain political leverage. Our veterans are not props, and they deserve the certainty and peace of mind that comes with permanent reauthorization.

I am very proud to have the support of Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), and Congressman Chris Pappas (D-NH), Chair of the House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. As a veteran myself, I want my friends on both sides of the aisle to know how important this cause is to me. I call on my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and to help up get it across the finish line.

1803,Mike Rounds,Senate,Republican,SD,,2021-06-08 19:23:35.403601,"***Update to Emergency Grazing & Haying Policies***

Historically, emergency Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grazing and haying requests could only be considered after state and national emergency declarations. However, the emergency CRP practice has been modified since South Dakota last experienced severe drought conditions.

Today, counties are authorized to approve CRP emergency haying and grazing applications outside of the Primary Nesting Season (PNS) of May 1 – August 1 on all practices when any part of the county is in a D2 condition based on the U.S. Drought Monitor. The current drought monitor for counties in South Dakota can be found here: https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?SD.

Emergency grazing during the PNS is allowed only when all of the following are met:
• payments are authorized for the county under LFP (D2 for 8 weeks, D3, or D4)
• less than 50 percent of the normal carrying capacity is maintained
• the participants conservation plan is modified to incorporate the 50 percent of normal carrying capacity, and approved prior to grazing.

In these instances, producers in the declared/affected counties and contiguous counties may file a modified conservation plan from the Natural Resources Conservation Services with their local Farm Service Agency (FSA) County Office to request emergency grazing or haying.

Furthermore, FSA may have resources to assist with inadequate water supply for grazing locations.

For more information, contact your FSA County office (https://offices.sc.egov.usda.gov/locator/app) or read additional materials on FSA’s website (https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/FactSheets/crp_haying_grazing_factsheet.pdf)

In 2020, an average of 17 people in the U.S. succumbed to their illnesses every day because they could not survive the wait for a viable organ. In certain parts of the country, the waitlist can be over five years for a kidney. Current law lacks clarity and prevents potential organ donations.

This legislation addresses those issues by removing the hurdles for potential donors and allowing new, innovative ways to increase organ donation. This would not only save taxpayer dollars but, most importantly, it would save lives. I am grateful to my colleague, Congressman Cartwright, for his leadership on this issue, and I look forward to ensuring this bill is passed and sent to the President’s desk.
