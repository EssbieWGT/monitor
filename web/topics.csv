A deranged man, with a list of target names in his pocket, showed up at a baseball field in 2017 to kill congressional Republicans.

Forty-one years ago, after two months of earthquakes and small explosions, Mount St. Helens cataclysmically erupted on May 18, 1980. It was the first large explosive eruption studied by scientists and observers using modern volcanology. The eruption and its effects were heavily photographed from numerous vantage points, but click here: http://ow.ly/kFxl50EN4gV to view rarely seen archival footage of the rising ash column. The digitized films were taken by USGS geologist Don Swanson from a fixed-wing surveillance aircraft using a Bell & Howell hand-wound 16mm movie camera.

According to the plan he unveiled, the first 20,000 Oklahomans currently receiving unemployment benefits who return to the workforce will receive a $1,200 incentive using federal funds from the American Rescue Plan.

While I normally do not comment on state government matters, I felt compelled to share my appreciation for Governor Stitt’s decision to utilize existing federal funds to incentivize Oklahomans to get back to work. Getting Oklahomans and Americans back in the workforce is critical to helping our economy get back on track. Indeed, there are jobs to fill, and I believe this is a responsible use of federal dollars. Governor Stitt and his Administration are to be commended for this wise use of the federal resources entrusted to them by Congress.

378,Tom Cole,House,Republican,OK,4,2021-05-18 10:05:11.000000,"Along with mathematics and science, study of civics and American history is key to a well-rounded education. Indeed, when Americans have a deeper understanding of our nation’s history and founding principles, they become more engaged citizens who participate in our government the way our Founding Fathers intended. It also preserves our republic and ensures a prosperous future for generations to come.

Sadly, the National Assessment of Education Progress has reported a nearly 27-year proficiency decline in these subjects. Moreover, only nine states require a full year of civics education be included in high school curricula, and 10 states do not require any sort of civics education at all. The weakened citizen knowledge of our nation’s history and understanding of our unique system of governance should alarm every American. For these reasons, I joined in sponsoring the Civics Secures Democracy Act, aimed at strengthening and expanding access to civics and history education across the United States. Unfortunately, this legislation has been conflated with support of a national curriculum threaded with liberal ideologies, including critical race theory.

To be clear, as written, this bill does not impose or incentivize the adoption of any national curriculum or promote teaching of critical race theory. In fact, the legislation explicitly prohibits such action. Indeed, mandating use of a national curriculum is something I do not and cannot support. Following an exchange with Education Secretary Miguel Cardona in my appropriations subcommittee, I am greatly concerned that by the Biden Administration’s new guidance, published in the Federal Register, for grant applicants and recipients of the existing American History and Civics Education programs. During our discussion, Secretary Cardona first stated that curriculum decisions are made at the state level with local control. However, he then contradicted that statement when he admitted that the U.S. Department of Education could condition grants on support of curricular content the Administration prioritizes.

I remain concerned about the U.S. Department of Education’s proposed priorities for grant recipients of the American History and Civics Education programs. While the guidance does not force a curriculum, it indicates what version of history and civics education the Administration believes should be taught and how that could impact similar civics grant programs in the future. In response, I sent a letter last week to Secretary Cardona, urging the Biden Administration to withdraw its proposed priorities. While I certainly support strengthening civics and American history knowledge in school systems across the country, I cannot support backdoor efforts to introduce critical race theory and elevate the widely disputed ideas put forward by the 1619 Project.

A long-form journalism initiative spearheaded by writers of the left-leaning New York Times, the 1619 Project was not developed by trained historians and has been the subject of criticism from leading members of historical academia concerning its credibility – so much so that it has required revision. The project’s main assertion is that “one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery.” In reducing the American Revolution to little more than a slaveholders’ rebellion, this project swats aside the weight of historical evidence and primary sources that run counter to this claim. That the Department of Education would elevate dubious historical scholarship in its proposed priorities speaks volumes about its intended direction for civics education and the importance of political narrative over historical fact.

As a former history professor and a tribal member of the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma, I appreciate the desire to offer diverse perspectives in education and recognize the discrimination faced by minority groups throughout history, including members of my own family. But I also know there is more to American history than just our country’s imperfections. Indeed, America has afforded my family, and many others, opportunities that exist nowhere else in the world. Even in the face of adversity and in spite of flaws, we can and should celebrate the nation, the values and the institutions that made the journey

The risk of nuclear war is the greatest it has been in over three decades, and the U.S. nuclear modernization strategy has morphed from one of deterrence to one of dominance. This is incredibly costly and puts our world at greater risk of crossing a line from which it cannot return.

As Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I will continue to do everything in my power to address this issue earnestly and thoroughly.

Today has proven that our country is capable of growth – that Congress will no longer sit in silence while communities suffer racism and hatred. Now is the time to recommit to moving forward with a shared vision for our future built upon basic human dignity.

He served as the President of the Kansas Hospital Association for 22 years, leading the KHA through a significant growth period, and was recognized accordingly by the American Hospital Association in 2003.

After I was elected to the Kansas Senate, he went out of his way to educate me on Kansas hospitals and our state’s health care system. Don realized how important hospitals are to our communities, and my efforts to support rural health care and Kansas hospitals are based on many of the conversations I had with Don.

He was an outstanding advocate and a good friend. Robba and I are sending our prayers to his family and all those he impacted throughout his life.

Each year, 40,000 people die in traffic accidents, and in almost every case, the denominator is the same – human error. The preventable loss of life on our roads is tragic and unacceptable.

It is important to say…”the future of”… because there is an assumption that these vehicles are already being sold commercially today when they certainly are not. Driverless vehicles are still in a very early testing stages and have a long way to go. Together, we can create a future with much safer roadways.

The grant opportunities will provide up to $10 million in grants for citizenship preparation programs in communities across the country.

These competitive grant opportunities are open to organizations that prepare lawful permanent residents for naturalization and promote civic integration through increased knowledge of English, U.S. history, and civics. USCIS received support from Congress through appropriations to make these funding opportunities available to communities.

USCIS seeks to expand availability of high-quality citizenship and integration services throughout the country under the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program:
• Citizenship Instruction and Naturalization Application Services: This opportunity will fund public or nonprofit organizations that offer both citizenship instruction and naturalization application services to lawful permanent residents. USCIS expects to award 33 organizations up to $250,000 each for two years through this opportunity. Applications are due by July 16, 2021.
• Refugee and Asylee Integration Services Program: This grant opportunity will provide extended integration services with a focus on individualized programming to former refugees and asylees to attain the skills and knowledge required for successful citizenship. It will also provide other services that foster a sense of belonging and attachment to the United States. The program has expanded eligibility to include lawful permanent residents who were admitted or entered the United States as Cuban or Haitian entrants or individuals admitted on a Special Immigrant Visa. USCIS expects to award six public or nonprofit organizations with experience in serving refugees up to $300,000 each for a period of two years through this opportunity. Applicants must design an integration support program that provides a suite of services to program beneficiaries to promote long-term civic integration and citizenship.

Applications are due by July 16, 2021.

USCIS expects to announce award recipients in September 2021.
