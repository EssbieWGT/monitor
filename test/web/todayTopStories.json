My wife and I had just brought our newborn home. I felt I was the luckiest person around. And then, overnight, my body betrayed me. I went to the doctor to treat what I thought was carpal tunnel from holding my baby for too long. Instead, the doctor diagnosed me with ALS, a neurological illness that has since left me nearly completely paralyzed. I was told I had three to four years left to live.",

        "description": "Dear members of Congress,\u00a0\r\nStudies have shown that paid family and medical leave is good for working families and good for the economic health of our nation.\u00a0\r\nPaid family and medical leave will allow working families to take paid time off when a birthing parent needs to recover from childbirth, or for parents to bond with their new child, it\u2019s needed to care for an aging or disabled family member having a health crisis, to deal with the military deployment of a loved one or to care for your own serious personal medical needs. Investing in our families also means investing in our economy and the prosperity of our nation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nIt saves taxpayer dollars by significantly lowering the use of other government programs like SNAP, helps businesses by lifting the load of full payment when someone is off of work for a critical crisis or new baby; and paid family and medical leave is a critical benefit for everyday families who are often faced with caregiving choices that put their loved ones and their economic security at risk.\u00a0\r\nA national paid family and medical leave program would bring about health equity as well as racial and economic justice. \u00a0 As the only industrialized country that fails to provide a national program, the impacts can be severe for many communities of color. Black women and Black, Indigenous People of Color and families who disproportionately lack access to paid family and medical leave\u00a0 are once again being failed by a system ingrained with systemic racism and bias.\u00a0 These gaps also mean people of color encounter even greater hardships when a health or family caregiving need occurs. Providing a universal paid family and medical leave program that is equitable will allow communities of color who, due to being denied wealth building opportunities, have fewer assets to rely on when a critical health crisis occurs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDuring this Congress, members have the opportunity to pass life-changing policies that will benefit working families and contribute to the economic longevity of our country. We ask that you act quickly to pass the Build Back Better Agenda with paid leave for all.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThank you,",
